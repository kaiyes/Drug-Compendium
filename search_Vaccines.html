          <h3>VARILRIX Inj. GlaxoSmithKlin   </h3>
          <p> Varilrix is a lyophilised preparation of the live attenuated Oka strain of varicella-zoster virus, obtained by propagation of the virus in MRC human diploid cell culture.
          Each dose of the reconsituted vaccine contains not less than 10 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the attenuated varicella-zoster virus.
          Ind: Active immunisation against varicella of healthy subjects from the age of 12 months onwards; active immunisation against varicella of susceptible high-risk patients and their susceptible healthy close-contacts.
          S/E: In healthy subjects, side-effects are very low and rare in all age groups.
          In age group 9 mon. to 12 years: papulov-esicular eruptions (4%); mild fever (5%).
          In age group 13 years & above with a
          2-dose schedule-no papulo-vesicular eruptions
          have been reported.
          General symptoms, such as headache, fever, paresthesia & fatigue are reported in 2.5% cases after each dose.
          In high-risk patients, papulo-vesicular
          eruptions, rarely accompanied by mild to
          moderate fever as in leukaemic patients (less than a quarter of patients). The appearanec of these eruptions do not influence the clinical mamagement of the patients.
          Precautions & warnings: After reconstitution, Varilrix TM should be administered immediately. Alcohol and other disinfecting agents must be allowed to evaporate from the skin before injection of the vaccine since they may inactivate the viruses. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. For this reason, the vaccinee should remain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after immunisation.
          Varilrix should not be administered intradermally & under no circumstances be administered intravenously.
          Dosage & Admin: 0.5ml of reconstituted
          vaccine contains one immunising dose.
          From the age of 12 months up to and including 12 years of age: 1 dose.
          13 years & above: 2 doses with an interval of 6 to 10 weeks.
          The same schedule should be applied for the high-risk patients also. In these patients, periodic measurement of varicella antibodies after vaccination may be indicated in order to identify those who may benefit from revaccination.
          Administration: Varilrix is for subcutaneous use only.
          Drug inter: Subjects who have received immunoglobulins or a blood transfusion, immunisation should be delayed for at least three months because of the likelihood of vaccine failure due to passively acquired varicella antibodies.
          Varilrix can be administered at the same time as any other vaccines. Different injectable vaccines should always be adiminstered at different injection sites. But, measles vaccine should not be given at the same time as Varilrix, at least at an interval of one month, since it is recognised that measles vaccination may lead to short lived supperssion of the cell mediated immune response. In high-risk patients, Varilrix should not be administered at the same time as other live attenuated vaccines. Inactivated vaccines may be administered in any temporal relationship to Varilrx, given that no specific contra-indications had been established.

            <h3>DUKORAL Oral Cholera Vaccine SBL Vaccine/ Healthcare   </h3>
            <p> The vaccine is presented as 3ml suspension in vail & the sodium hydrogen carbonate buffer as effervescent granules in sachet.
            Comp: A total of 1x1011 bacteria of the V cholera with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (rCTB) 1mg are present in the vaccine.
            Ind: Active immunization against diseases caused by V cholera & enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli (ETEC).
            C/I: None stated.
            S/E: Gastrointestinal symptoms (upset stomach), related to the sodium hydrogen carbonate, may occur occasionally.
            Precautions & warnings: Vaccination should be postponed in cases of acute illness.
            Pregnancy & lactation: May be aministered during pregnancy and to lactating women. Dosage & admin: Adults & children aged over 6 years: 2 doses; Children 2 to 6 years: 3 doses. Doses are to be given at intervals of at least one week but less than 6 weeks apart. If more than 6 weeks elapse between doses, basic immunization should be re-started. Immunization should be completed at least one week prior to traveling or potential exposure to the pathogens.
            Preparation of vaccine: The buffer is dissolved in a glass of water (approximately 150ml). Dukoral vaccine should be mixed with the buffer solution and drunk. The solution is raspberry flavoured. For the children 2 to 6 years of age- half the maount of the buffer sodium hydrogen carbonate solution is poured away and the remaining part (approximately 75ml) is mixed with the vaccine and drunk. Drug Inter: The vaccine is acid labile. Consequently, food and drink should be avoided 1 hour before and 1 hour after vaccination.
            Storage: Keep refrigerated (+2-82C). Note: For further information, please consult manufacturer's literature.

          <h3> TRITANRIX HB Inj. GlaxoSmithKline  </h3>
          <p>   Tritanrix HepB, a combination vaccine of DPT and Hepatitis B; 0.5ml/vial: injection.
          Tritanrix HB vaccine contains diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, inactivated pertussis bacteria and the purified major surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), adsorbed on aluminium salts. Ind: Tritanrix HB is indicated for active immunisation against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and hepatitis B in infants from 6 weeks onwards.
          C/I: Known hyersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, or history of hypersensitivity after administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or HB vaccines previously. ii. Acute severe febrile illness. iii. child suffering from encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine. In these circumstances the vaccination course should be continued with DT and Hb vaccines. iv. Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. v. convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days.
          S/E: Unusual crying, drowsiness, irritability, gastrointestinal symptoms and feeding problems were observed during clinical trials. These events were reported within 48 hours and in less than 5.0% of the cases were considered as severe. Fever was recorded in 40% but in most cases it was mild to moderate. These events lasted only for a few days.
          Very rare anaphylaxis, allergic reactions including anaphylactoid reactions and serum sickness like disease, have been reported. Convulsions and thrombocyto-penia have been reported very rarely with hepatitis B containing vaccines.
          Fatigue, malaise, headache, arthralgia, myalgia and urticaria have also been reported. Precautions & warnings: Persistent crying lasting >3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. There may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh possible risks.
          Trianrix hepb should under no circums-tances be administered intravenously.
          Dosage & admin: The recommended dose (0.5ml) of the vaccine must be administered by deep intrmauscular (i.m) injection, preferably in the anterolateral part of thigh. In patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders, the vaccine should be admini-stered subcutaneously. The primary vaccination schedule consists of 3 doses within the first six months of life.
          Vaccination schedule & booster dose:
          Where hepatitis B vaccine is not given at birth,
          the combined vaccine can be administered beginning as early as 8 weeks of age. Where there is a high endemicity of hepatitis B, the practice to administer hepatitis B vaccine at birth should be continued. In these circums- tances, vaccina-tion with the combined vaccine should start at 6 weeks of age. 3 vaccine doses must be administered at intervals of at least 4 weeks.
          At this moment, insufficient data are available to support the recommendation of a booster dose of the combined vaccine. The administration of a booster dose with DPT vaccine is recommended before the end of the second year of life. For longterm protection, a booster dose of HB vaccine could also be administered after the first year of life. However, the need for this dose is currently not established.
          Vaccination for infants born to HBs Ag+positive mothers:
          In the case of children born of known hepatitis B carrier mothers the immunoprophylactic measures for hepatitis B should not be modified. This may require separate vaccination with hepatitis B and DPT vaccines and also include the administration of HBIg at birth.
          For further information, see below under the text of Hepatitis B vaccine.
          Interaction with other vaccines & drugs: Previous experiences with simultaneous administration of DPT, OPV and HB vaccines have not shown any interference. no interference in the immune response to any of the antigens was observed as compared to the responses observed following adminis-tration of the vaccines at separate sites.
          In patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate response may not be achieved.
          Shelf-life: The tritanrix HB vaccine should be stored at a temperature between +2°C to +9° C. when the vaccine is stored under prescribed conditions the shelf-life is 36 months.

          <p> Freeze-dried Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus protein 10mcg/vial. Other ingredients- trometamol 0.6mg & saccharose 42.5mg/vial. Single dose presentation with diluent for injection 0.5ml: s.c or i.m injection
          Ind: Act-HIB is indicated for the prevention, in infants from 2 months, of invasive diseases caused by H. influenzae type b (viz. meningitis, septicaemia, cellulitis, arthritis, epiglottitis etc). Act-HIB does not protect against infections due to other types of H. influenzae, nor against other meningitis of other origins.
          C/I: Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, particu-larly the tetanus protein, or to subjects
          having shown signs of hypersensitivity with administration of Hib vaccines.
          Fever or acute infection (a minor infection is not
          contraindicated).
          S/E: No serious local or general reaction observed following administration of the vaccine. The reported local signs/symptoms that occur within the first 48 hours are mild redness, swelling and pain at the site of injection, which resolves spontaneously. The general symptoms that reported within the first 48 hours are fever, loss of appetite, restlessness, vomiting, diarrhoea and unusual crying, wich are also mild and resolves spontaneously.
          Precautions & warnings: As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. For this reason, medical supervision should continue for 30minutes after immunistion.
          Although limited immune response to the tetanus toxoid component may occur, vaccination with ACT HIB alone does not subsitute for rutine tetanus vaccination.
          Dosage & admin: Primary vaccination: from 2 months- 3 injections at 1 or 2 months intervals followed by a booster 12 months after the third dose.
          Second chance vaccination: when it has not been possible to give the child a primary vaccination- (i) between 6 and 12 months: 2 injections at 1 or 2 months intervals followed by a booster 12 months after the second dose; (ii) from 12 months and up to 5 years: a single injection.
          Drug inter: ACT-HIB can be administered either simultaneously or at any time before or after a different inactivated or live vaccine. Other injectable vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites. In patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodefici-ency, an adequate response may not be achieved.

Each single dose of vaccine is formulated to contain 10mcg of purified capsular polysaccharide, covalently bound to approximately 30mcg tetanus toxoid. Ind: Active immunisation of all infants from the age of 6 weeks against Hib infection disease (viz. meningitis, septicaemia, cellulitis, arthritis, epiglottitis etc). Hiberix does not protect against infection due to other types of H. influenzae nor against meningitis caused by other organisms. C/I; S/E; Cautions: See above under ACT HIB vaccine.
            Dosage & Admin: The primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses in the first 6 months of life and can start from the age of 6 weeks. Infants between the ages of 6 and 12 months previously unvaccinated should receive 2 injections, given with an interval of one month, followed by a booster in the second year of life. Previously unvaccinated children aged 1-5 years should be given one dose of vaccine. To ensure a long-term protection, a booster dose is recomme-nded in the second year of life. As vaccination schemes vary from country to country, the schedule for eah country may be used in accordance with the different national recomme-ndations. Method of administration: The reconstituted vaccine is for intramuscular injection, and under no circumstances be administered intravenously. But however, in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders, it is good clinical practice that the vaccine should be administered subcutaneously.

    <p>  Salmonella typhi Vi purified capsular polysaccharide 0.025mg (with other preservative ingedients) per single dose pre-filled syringe with water as diluent qs 0.5ml: i.m (or s.c) injection Ind: Prevention of typhoid fever in adults and children over 5 years of age, specially travellers to endemic areas, immigrants, health care professionals, and military personnel. Between 2 and 5 years of age, the decision to vaccinate should be based on careful evaluation of the risk of typhoid fever in the light of the
    epidemiological situation.
    C/I: Hypersensitivity to a constituent of the vaccine. Children under 5 years- the antibody response as yet undocumented, vaccination is usually not advised; and as because typhoid fever is rare in infants, vaccination of children under 2 years of age is also not recommended.
    S/E: Mild pain at the site of injection; infrequent erythema or induration may also occur at the injection site. Mild fever is observed in 1-5% of cases.
    Precautions & warnings: This vaccine protects against infection by Salmonella typhi but does not protect against Salmonella paratyphi A or B. Immunization should be postponed in subjects with faver or acute infection. Pregnancy and lactation- the risk during pregnancy is not yet known; expected benefits must be carefully evaluated in the light of the epidemiological situation.
    Dosage & admin: A single injection ensures protection, a second injection is not justified, (but to a limited number of subjects, a second injection has been given). Protection lasts for at least 3 years. The preferred route of administration is intramuscular although it may also be given subcutaneously.
    Storage: To be kept refrigerated (between +2°C and + 8°C).
