    <h3>XELODA Tab. Roche</h3>
    <p>Capecitabine 500mg/tablet.
It is a unique, tumour-activated, oral therapy, for patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid cancers.Mode of action: Following absorption through the intestine, capecitabine is converted to 5- fluorouracil through three steps of enzymatic action- initially in the liver cells and then either in the liver or in the tumour cells by two enzyme action, viz. carboxylesterase & cytidine deaminase respectively & finally in the tumour by the action of enzyme 'thymidine phosphorylase' (TP). 5- fluorouracil is then incorporated into tumour cell DNA and RNA and inhibits thymidylate synthetase and consequently tumour cells proliferation.
Ind: Capecitabine is indicated as first-line therapy in advanced colorectal cancer. Treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer resistant to both paclitaxel and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen or resistant to paclitaxel and for whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated.
C/I: Known hypersensitivity to capecitabine or fluoropyrimidine. It is also contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30ml/min).
S/E: Capecitabine is generally well tolerated. Commonly capecitabine causes low incidence of myelosuppression, hair loss, neurological toxicity, and nausea & vomiting. The majority of adverse effects occur during the first cycle of therapy.
The incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities in a clinical study is shown as following- diarrhea (14%), hand-foot syndrome (10%), fatigue and stomatitis (7%), neutropenia (3%), neurotoxicity (1%), alopecia (0%). (Hand-foot syndrome is redness or
erythema and discomfort of the palms and soles). Precautions: Patients receiving therapy with capecitabine should be monitored by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents.
Most adverse events are reversible and do not require permanent discontinuation of therapy, although doses may need to be withheldor reduced.
Pregnancy & lactation: Capecitabine is not recommened in pregnant women. It should also be avoided in a nursing mother unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the nursing infant. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with capecitabine. Dosage & Admin: Capecitabine tablets are administered orally with water, and are given within 30 minutes after a meal. The total daily dose of capecitabine is to be given into two divided doses (morning and evening). Intermittent therapy- the recommended dosage for capecitabine monotherapy is 2500mg/m2/day (maximum tolerated dose as 3000mg/m2/day) for 3 two weeks cycle with an interval of one-week rest following each cycle. The patients responding to initial (3 cycle) therapy should continue capecitabine till they maintain tumour response or stable disease. Continuous therapy- the maximum tolerated dose for capecitabine monotherapy is 1650mg/m2/day as continuous schedule. The rest period is avoided in continuous therapy. There is no need for prior adjustment of the dose for mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases.
Combination dose with docetaxel- 2500mg/m2/day for 1-14 days can be given with 75mg/m2 ofdocetaxelforonceinthereeweeks. Combination dose with paclitaxel- 1650mg/m2/ day for day 1-14 (using the intermittent schedule) can be safely administered with paclitaxel175mg/m2 (every3weeks)regardless of the extent of prior therapy.
Drug inter: Capecitabine and its metabolites do not significantly bind with plasma proteins. Capecitabine does not induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. It is therefore unlikely that capecitabine will interact with other pharmaceutical agents. Capecitabine can be administered concomitantly with antacids, antihistamines, NSAIDs, morphine, paracetamol, antiemetics, and H2 antagonists without clinically significant effects.

    <h3>CYTARABINE Inj. Choongwae/NTS</h3>
    <p>Cytarabine (Cytosine arabinoside) 100mg/5ml vial: Injection for i.v infusion.
Mode of action: Cytarabine is a cytotoxic antimetabolite. It's exact mechanism of action is unknown. In the body, cytarabine is converted to cytarabine triphosphate which inhibits the synthesis of DNA (by interfering with pyrimidine synthesis- a component of DNA) by inhibiting DNA polymerise.Ind: Predominant use in the induction of remission of acute myelocytic leukaemia. Used singly or in combination therapy with other chemotherapeutic agents for the remission induction in lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, erythroleukaemia and in the treatment and maintenance therapy of meningeal leukaemia and other meningeal neoplasma.
C/I: Cytarabine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug.
A/R: The major adverse effect of cytarabine is haematologic toxicity.
Myelosuppressinon is manifested by megaloblastosis, leucopenia, anaemia, reticulopenia and thrombocytopenia. The severity of these adverse effects depend on the dose and the schedule of administration.
Nausea and vomiting usually occur more frequently following rapid i.v administration as opposed to continuous infusion of the drug. Other adverse effects of the GI tract include- anorexia, diarrhoea, oral and anal inflmmation, abdominal pain, oesophagitis, sore throat, oesophageal ulceration and GI haemorrhage. Due to its immunosuppressive effect viral,
bacterial, fungal and parasitic infection may occur. Hepatic dysfunction characterised by jaundice, elevation in serum bilirubin, transaminase and alkaline phosphatases have also ocurred.
Other less major adverse effects include- fever, rash, conjuctivitis, alopecia, chest pain, dizziness, myalgia, bone pain, hyperuricaemia, cardiac and respiratory distress etc.
Use in lactation: Women should be advised not to breast-feed while being treated with cytarabine. Dosage & admin: Single drug therapy in the induction of remission in adults with acute myelocytic leukaemia:
Cytarabine 200mg/m2 daily by continuous i.v infusion over 24 hrs for 5 days (120 hrs)- total dose 1000mg/m2.
The course is repeated every 2 weeks. Modifications based on haematologic response should be made. Clinical experience to date indicates that success with cytarabine therapy depends more on adeptness in modifying day to day dosage to obtain maximum leukaemia cell kill with tolerable toxicity. Therefore dosage of cytarabine must be based on clinical and haematologic response & tolerance of the patient.
Cytarabine can be administered intravenously either as a bolus push or as a continuous infusion. It may also be administered subcutaneously or intrathecally.
Cytarabine combination therapy: Plesae see package insert.
Drug inter: To be cautious when using other myelosuppressive drugs concurrently as the incidence and severity of haemotologic toxicity may be exacerbated.
Patient may develop acute pancreatitis during cytarabine treatment if he had prior treatment with L-asparaginase.

    <h3>AVASTIN Tab. Roche</h3>
    <p>Bevacizumab 25mg/ml; 4ml (100mg) vial: Injection.
    Ind: Bevacizumab in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum.
    C/I: Bevacizumab is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of the product (chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human or humanised antibodies).
    S/E: Common adverse events of any grade that were identified as possibly bevacizumab related toxicities were anorexia, constipation, epistaxis, hypertension, proteinuria and pain. Patients
    treated with bevacizumab with or without chemotherapy in any trials included decreased neutrophil count, decreased white blood count, protein urine present, decreased blood potassium, decreased blood phosphorus, increased blood glucose and increased blood alkaline phosphatase. Precautions: Hypertension: Caution should be exercised before initiated bevacizumab therapy in these patients. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during bevacizumab therapy. Wound healing: It is recommended that bevacizumab therapy not be initiated within 28 days following major surgery as such patients were excluded from clinical trials.
    Pregnancy & lactation: Bevacizumab should not be used during pregnancy. In women with childbearing potential, appropriate contraceptive measures are recommended during bevacizumab therapy. Women should be advised to discontinue nursing during bevacizumab therapy and not to breast feed for at least 6 months following the last dose of the therapy.
    Dosage & admin: The recommended dose of bevacizumab is 5mg/kg of body weight given once every 14 days as an intravenous infusion. Bevacizumab should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Withdraw the volume of bevacizumab equivalent to a dose of 5mg/kg body weight and dilute in a total volume of 100ml of sterile, pyrogen-free 0.9% sodium chloride. No incompatibilities between bevacizumab and polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin bags have been observed (error! reference source not found). Bevacizumab infusions should not be administered or mixed with dextrose or glucose solutions (error! reference source not found). Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. The initial bevacizumab dose should be delivered over 90 minutes as an intravenous infusion. If the first infusion is well tolerated,
    the second infusion may be administered over 60 minutes. If the 60-minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes.
    After resolution of the vial content chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours at 2°C-30°C in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. However, from a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately.
    Drugs inter: No formal drug interaction studies with other antineoplastic agents have been conducted. However, the existing data suggest that bevacizumab does not affect the pharmacokinetics of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), carboplatin, paclitaxel and doxorubicin.
    Storage: Store vials in a refrigerator at 2°C-8°C. Keep vial in the outer carton of the refrigerator due to light sensitivity. Do not freeze. Do not shake. 4ml (100mg) vial x l's pack: 39375.00 MRP</p>
