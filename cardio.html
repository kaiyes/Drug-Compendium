        <h3>ADENOSINE-PRESCRIBING NOTES</h3>
        <p> 
        <h4>ADENOSINE: Injection</h4>
        <p> Adenosine BP 6mg/2ml ampoule: i.v injection</p>         
        <strong>Mode of action:</strong> 
         Adenosine slows conduction time through the A-V node, can interrupt the reentry pathways through the A-V node, and can restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.<br><br>
        <strong>Ind:</strong> Constipation, heart-burn, gas and nausea. Acute and chronic constipation due to hyperacidity and peptic ulcer. 
        </p>
        <p>Intravenous adenosine is indicated for the following:
        Conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) to sinus rhythm, including that associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome).</p>
        <p>
        <strong>C/I: </strong> Adenosine is contraindicated in: 1. Second or third degree A-V block (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker). 2. Sinus node disease, such as sick sinus syndrome or symptomatic bradycardia (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker). 3. Known hypersensitivity to adenosine.
        </p>

        <p> <strong>S/E: </strong>The following reactions were reported with intravenous adenosine use: Cardiovascular: Facial flushing, headache, sweating, palpitations, chest pain, hypertention. Respiratory: Shortness of breath/ dyspnea, chest pressure, hyperventilation, and head pressure. Central nervous system: Lightheadedness, dizziness, tingling in arms, numbness, apprehension, blurred vision, burning sensation, heaviness in arms, neck & back pain. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, metallic taste, tightness in throat, pressure in groin.
        In post-market clinical experience with adenosine use, following reactions have been reported: Prolonged asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, transient increase in blood pressure, bradycardia, hypotension, atrial fibrillation and bronchospasm.</p>

        <p> <strong>Precaution: Pregnancy & lactation: </strong>Since it is not known whether adenosine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women, adenosine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
        </P>

        <p><strong>Doses: Adults : </strong>Initial dose, 6mg given as rapid i.v bolus (administered over 1-2 seconds period). Repeat dose: If the first dose does not result in elimination of the supraventricular tachycardia within 1-2 minutes, 12mg should be given as rapid intravenous bolus; this 12mg dose may be repeated for second time if required. 
        </p>

        <p> <strong>Children:</strong> 
        The dosages used in neonates, infants, children & adolescents were equivalent to those administered to adults on a weight basis.
        Pediatric patients with a body weight  less than 50kg: Initial dose, 0.05 to 0.1mg/kg as a rapid i.v bolus given either centrally or peripherally. A saline flush should follow.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Repeat dose:</strong>If conversion of PSVT does not occur within 1-2 minutes, additional bolus injections of adenosine can be administered at incrementally higher doses, increasing the amount given by 0.05 to 0.1mg/kg. A saline flush should follow. This process should continue until sinus rhythm is established or a maximum single dose of 0.3mg/kg is used. Pediatric patients with a body weight >50kg: The adult dose is recommended. Doses greater than 12mg are not recommended for adult & pediatric patients.


        <p> <strong>Drug Inter:</strong> Intravenous adenosine injection has been effectively administered in the presence of other cardioactive drugs, such as quinidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel
        blocking agents and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors without any change in the adverse reaction profile. Digoxin and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with adenosine. Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, adenosine should be used with caution in the presence of these agents. The use of adenosine in patients receiving digitalis may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation. The effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines, such as caffeine and theophylline.

        </p>


        <p> <strong>Storage:</strong> Store in a cool dry place protected from light. Do not refrigerate as crystallization may occur. If crystallization has occurred, dissolve crystals by warming to room temperature. The solution must be clear at the time of use.

          <h3>AMIODARONE-Prescribing Notes</h3>
          <p> 
          <h4>AMIODARONE: Tablet</h4>
          Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug, used to correct abnormal rhythms of the heart.<br><br>
          <strong>Mode of  action:</strong>  Amiodarone is considered as a 'broad spectrum' antiarrhythmic drug. Its
		important electrical effects are-<br>
		i. a delay in the rate at which the heart's electrical system 'recharges' after the heart contracts (repolarization);<br>
		 ii. a prolongation in the electrical phase during which the heart's muscle cells are electrically stimulated (action potential);<br>
		  iii. a slowing of the speed of electrical conduction (how fast each individual impulse is conducted through the heart's electrical system); <br>
		  iv. a reduction in the rapidity of firing of the normal generator of electrical impulses in the heart (the heart's pacemaker);<br>
		   v. a slowing of conduction through various specialized electrical pathways (called accessory pathways) which can be responsible for arrhythmias. In addition to being an antiarrhythmic medication, amiodarone also causes blood vessels to dilate (enlarge), as a result, there is a drop in blood pressure. Because of this effect, it also may be of benefit in patients with congestive heart failure.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Ind:</strong>Amiodarone is used for many serious arrhythmias of the heart including ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. 
          </p>


 
          <p> <strong>S/E: </strong></p>The most severe side effects of amiodarone therapy are related to the lungs. These effects can be fatal. Patients should report any symptoms of cough, fever, or painful breathing. Although quite rare, fatal liver toxicity may occur with amiodarone therapy. Reversible corneal microdeposits (sometimes with night glare), rarely impaired vision due to optic neuritis; peripheral neuropathy and myopathy (usually reversible on withdrawal); bradycardia and conduction disturbances; phototoxicity and rarely persistent skin discoloration; hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism; raised serum trasaminases (may require dose reduction or withdrawal if accompanied by acute liver disorders); jaundice, hepatitis and cirrhosis reported; rarely nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, tremor, sweating, vertigo, headache, sleeplessness, fatigue, alopecia, benign raised intracranial pressure, ataxia, rashes, hypersensitivity including vasculitis, renal involvement and thrombocytopenia; haemolytic or aplastic anaemia. In some cases, dose of amiodarone can be reduced. In other cases, amiodarone therapy may need to be stopped.

          <p> <strong>Pregnancy & lactation: </strong>In general, amiodarone should not be administered during pregnancy because there have been reports of hypo- or hyperthyroidism in infants from oral amiodarone use during pregnancy. If amiodarone use is considered essential, however, the patient should be warned of the risk to the fetus. The safe use of amiodarone in women who are breast-feeding has not neen established.
          </P>

          <p><strong>Doses:  </strong> Amiodarone usually is given in several daily doses to minimize stomach upset whcih is seen more frequently with higher doses. For this same reason, it is also recommended that amiodarone should be taken with meals. Oral dose is 200mg 3 times daily for 1 week, reduced to 200mg twice daily, or the minimum dose required to control arrhythmia.
          </p>

         

          <p> <strong>Drug Inter:</strong> Amiodarone may interact with beta-blockers such as atenolol, propranolol,metoprolol, or certain calcium-channel blockers, such as verapamil or diltiazem, resulting in an excessively slow heart rate. Amiodarone increases the blood levels of digoxin when the two drugs are given together. Flecainide blood concentrations increase by more than 50% with amiodarone. Procainamide and quinidine concentrations increase by 30-50% during the first week of amiodarone therapy. Amiodarone also can interact with tricyclic antidepressants. Amiodarone interacts with warfarin and increases the risk of bleeding. Amiodarone inhibits the metabolism of dextromethorphan.

          <h3>DISOPYRAMIDE-Prescribing Notes</h3>
          <p> 
          <h4>DISOPYRAMIDE: Capsule</h4>
          Disopyramide phosphate is a type 1 anti- arrhythmic drug.<br><br>
          <strong>Mode of  action:</strong> In animal studies disopyramide decreases the rate of diastolic depolarization in cells with augmented automaticity, decreases the upstroke velocity and increases the action potential duration of normal cardiac cells, decreases the disparity of refractoriness between infarcted and adjacent normally perfused myocardium and has no effect on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. As a result it reduces heartbeat.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Ind: </strong>Ventricular arrhythmias particularly following myocrdial infarction; also effective in supraventricular & paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and in wolf-parkinson-white syndrome. 
          </p>


          <p>
          <strong>C/I: </strong>Disopyramide is contraindicated in the pre-existing A-V heart block, shock, glaucoma, urinary retention and known hypersensitivity to the drug. 
          </p>

          <p> <strong>S/E: </strong>Usually disopyramide is well tolerated but occasionally in some cases dry mouth, nose & eye; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloating; blurred vision, urinary problems, headache, skin rash, dizziness, nervousness & impotence (1-3%) may occur.</p>

          <p> <strong>Caution: </strong>Disopyramide should not be administered to patients with cardiomyopathy & associated congestive heart failure unless the patient is digitalized and adequately compensated. Disopyramide should be used with caution in the presence of digitalis intoxication.
          </P>

          <p><strong>Doses: Adults : </strong> The recommended initial dose is 400mg daily in 4 divided doses i.e 100mg 6 hourly, then 150mg 6 hourly, adjusting to maintenance,
          400-800mg daily in divided doses.
          Patients in whom rapid control of ventricular arrhythmia is essential, an initial loading dose of 300mg disopyramide is recommended, followed by the appropriate maintenance dosage.
          In patients with renal insufficiency, dosage schedule should be made according to the creatinine clearance rate. If clearance rate is 40-30ml/min, give 100mg 8 hourly; if 30-15ml/min, 100mg 12 hourly; if >15ml/min, 100mg in 24 hours.
          </p>



          <p> <strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, so disopyramide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fefus. As the nursing infants are potentially in the risk of serious adverse
          reactions, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
          </p>
          <p> <strong>Children:</strong> Not recommended.
          </p>

          <p> <strong>Drug Inter:</strong>Drug interactions may occur if disopyramide is used along with beta-adrenoceptor blockers or verapamil, lignocaine, phenytoin, procainamide or erythromycin.

          <strong>C/I: </strong>Treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias including ventricular tachyarrhythmias, symptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Prophylaxis of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia or fibrillation, paroxysmal AV re-entrant tachycardias (both nodal and involving accessory pathways), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia after cardiac surgery, maintenance of sinus rhythm following cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter.
          </p>

          <p> <strong>S/E: </strong></p>The most significant adverse effects are those which are typical of its class-I and class-II (cardiac action potential duration prolongation) effects.

          <p> <strong>Caution: </strong>Sotalol is not for everyone with irregular heartbeats (atrial fibrillation). Sotalol is not indicated for those patients who have serious kidney problems or are on kidney dialysis, lung disease causing shortness of breath (such as asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema), symptoms of heart failure (such as shortness of breath when in exercise or physically active and swelling of the ankles or legs), very slow heart beat and do not have an implanted artificial pacemaker.
          </P>

          <p><strong>Doses: Adults : </strong> Initially 80mg daily in single or 2 divided doses. After ECG monitoring and measurement of corrected QT interval, arrhythmias, dose is increased gradually at intervals of 2-3 days to usual dose of 160- 320mg daily in 2 divided doses; higher doses of 480-640mg daily for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias should be given under specialist supervision. The dosage should be reduced in renal impair-ment. If creatinine clearance is >60ml/min, recommended dose is 160mg twice daily; if creatinine clearance between 40 and 60ml/min, the dose is 160mg once daily. In patients with creatinine clearance less than 40ml/min, sotalol is contraindicated.
          </p>



          <p> <strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Its use throughout pregnancy should be avoided unless it is absolutely necessary as it crosses the placenta and may cause foetal bardycardia. Infants should not be fed with breast milk from mothers being treated with sotalol.
          </p>

          

          <p> <strong>Drug Inter:</strong>In combined therapy, clonidine should not be discontinued until several days after withdrawal of sotalol. Use with great caution with drugs that also prolong QT interval, e.g disopyramide, amiodarone, class-I antiarrhythmic agents, calcium antagonists of the verapamil type or tricyclic antidepressants. Interactions also occur with phenothiazines, terfenadine, astemizole and diltiazem. Concomitant use of reserpine, guanethidine, or alpha methyldopa requires close monitoring for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, syncope. Hypoglycemia may occur and the dosage of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may require adjustment.

          <h3> CLONIDINE - Prescribing Notes  </h3>
          <p> 
          <h4> CATAPRES Tab. Navana   </h4><br>
          Clonidine hydrochloride USP 0.1mg and 0.3mg/tablet.

           <p><strong>Mode of Action: </strong>  Clonidine hydrochloride stimulates alpha-adrenoreceptors in the barin stem. This action results in reduced sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system and in decreased in peripheral resistance, renal vascular resistance, heart rate, and blood pressure.  
          </p>


          <p><strong>Ind: </strong>Clonidine is indicated in multiple uses: i. Hypertensive urgencies, resistant hypertension and atrial fibrillation; ii. For the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder- ADHD (is characterized by behavioral and learning disorder); iii. Autism, (a development disturbance, characterized by an abnormal or impaired development in social communications and interaction skills and significantly restricted range of activities and interests); iv. Tourette's syndrome, (a neurological disorder in which the major symptom is tics which are sudden, brief, involuntary movements or sounds); v. For growth retardation, (clonidine has been reported to be a stimulant of growth hormone release, presumably as a result of central alpha adrenergic
          stimulation); vi. Menopausal hot flash; and vii. Opioid detoxification.    
          </p>


          <p>
          <strong>C/I: </strong>  Any hypersensitivity to clonidine.
          </p>

          <p> <strong>S/E: </strong> Most adverse effects are mild and tend to diminish with continued therapy. The most frequent adverse effects (which appear to be dose related) are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation and sedation. Less frequent adverse effects are headache, with-drawal syndrome, tachycardia, bradycardia, depression, nervousness, anxiety, restlessness, urticaria, urine retention etc.  </p>

          <p> <strong>Pregnancy & lactation: </strong>  No adequate, well controlled stuides have been conducted in pregnant women. So, it should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. As clonidine is excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when it is administered to nursing mother.
          </P>

          <p><strong>Doses: Adults: </strong> i. Hypertensive urgencies, 0.1mg twice daily to manage the hypertensive crisis than tailing off the therapy; resistant hypertension, 0.1mg twice daily; atrial fibrillation, 0.075mg once or twice daily alone or with digoxin; ii. For the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 5mcg/kg/day. iii. Autism, 0.15mg to 0.2mg/day. iv. Tourette's syndrome, 150- 200mcg/day. v. For growth retardation, 37.5- 150mcg/m2/day. vi. Menopausal hot flash, 0.1mg to 0.4mg daily for up to 2 weeks.     
          </p>

          

          <p> <strong>Drug Inter:</strong> i. Hypertensive urgencies, 0.1mg twice daily to manage the hypertensive crisis than tailing off the therapy; resistant hypertension, 0.1mg twice daily; atrial fibrillation, 0.075mg once or twice daily alone or with digoxin; ii.

          <h3> PROPRANOLOL Prescribing Notes </h3>
<p>
<strong>PROPRANOLOL HCI:</strong> <br>Tablet/Capsule/ Injection.<br><br>
Propranolol hydrochloride is a selective b1-blocker.<br><br>
<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Propranolol, as a selective b1-blocker, it blocks the effects of adrenergic stimulation mediated through these receptors. The cardio-selectivity is dose-related. Propranolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by lowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin activity & sympathetic outflow from CNS. Propranolol also causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue of its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.<br><br>

<strong>Ind: </strong>Propranolol is indicated in- i. the control of essential and renal hypertension, ii. the management of angina pectoris, iii. the long term prophylaxis after recovery from acute myocardial infarction, iv. the control of most forms of cardiac arhythmia, v. the prophylaxis of migraine, vi. the management of essential tremor, vii. the control of anxiety and anxiety tachycardia, viii. the adjunctive management of thyrotoxicosis and thyrotoxic crisis, ix. management of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, x. management of phaeochromocytoma (with an alpha blocker).<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Propranolol should not be used in the presence of- i. second or third degree heart block, ii. cardiogenic shock, iii. history of bronchospasm, iv. after prolonged fasting, v. metabolic acidosis (e.g in some diabetics), vi. several peripheral vascular disease (including intermittent claudication), vii. sick sinus syndrome, viii. uncontrolled heart failure, ix. hypotension, x. untreated phaeocromocytoma, xi. Prinzmetal's angina.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Pronounced fatigue and cold extremities have been observed in 10-20% of the treated subjects. Complaints about bradycardia, dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms are less frequent. Despite its relative selectivity, atenolol can cause bronchospasms in asthma patients. Rarely observed side-effects are sleep disturbances, depression, paresthesiae, impotence, exanthema, psoriasis exacebations and arthropathies. Clinically relevant changes in the blood sugar have hardly occurred. There is no clarity as to the practical significance of the above mentioned changes in the lipid metabolism.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Special care should be taken with patients whose cardiac reserve is poor. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs should be avoided in overt heart failure. However, they may be used in patients whose signs of failure have been controlled. Heart failure due to thyrotoxicosis often responds to propranolol alone, but if other adverse factors co-exist myocardial contractility must be maintained and signs of failure controlled with digitalis and diuretics.One of the pharmacological actions of propranolol is to reduce heart rate. In the rare instance when symptoms may be attributable to the slow heart rate, the dose may be reduced.<br>

Propranolol modifies the tachycardia, of hypoglycaemia. Caution should be exercised in the concurrent use of propranolol and hypoglycaemic therapy in diabetic patients. Propranolol may prolong the hypoglycaemic response to insulin.<br>

In patients suffering from ischaemic heart disease, as with other beta-blocking agents, treatment should not be discontinued abruptly. Either the equivalent dosage of another beta-blocker may be substituted or the withdrawal of propranolol should be gradual. Care should be taken in the parenteral administration of preparations containing adrenaline to patients taking beta-blocking drugs as, in rare cases, vasoconstriction, hypertension and bradycardia may result.<br>

Caution should be exercised when transferring patients from clonidine to beta-blocker. If beta-blockers and clonidine are given concurrently, clonidine should not be discontinued until several days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker (see also prescribing information on clonidine).
Care should be taken in prescribing a beta-blocker with class 1 antidysrhythmic agents such as disopyramide. Beta-blockers should be used with caution in combination with verapamil in patients with impaired ventricular function. The combination should not be given to patients with conduction abnormalities. Neither drug should be administered intravenously within 48 hours of discontinuing the other.
Anaesthesia: It is not advisable to withdraw beta-blockers prior to surgery in the majority of patients.<br>

However, care should be taken when using anaesthetic agents such as ether, cyclopropane and trichloroethylene. Vagal dominance, if it occurs, may be corrected with atropine
(1-2mg i.v).<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> As with all other drugs, it should not be given in pregnancy unless its use is essential. There is no evidence of teratogenicity with propranolol.<br><br>
<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> By mouth: Adult-Hypertension, initially 80mg twice daily increasing if necessary at weekly intervals to 160-320 mg daily. Anxiety, 40mg 2-3 times daily increasing if necessary at weekly interval upto 120-140mg/ day.
Phaeochromocytoma, 60mg daily with an alpha-blocker for 3 days preoperatively or 30mg daily in inoperable case.
Arrythmias, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, anxiety tachycardia and thyrotoxicosis- 10-40mg 3-4 times daily. Anxiety with symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, tremor etc., 40mg 2-3 times daily. Child: 0.25-0'5mg/kg body-Wt. 3 or 4 times daily.<br>
<strong>By intravenous injection:</strong>
1mg over 1 min. Preceded by atropine sulph.

1-2 mg; if necessary, repeat at 2 min. intervals; max. 10 mg (5mg in anaesthesia).<br>
Prophylaxis after infarction- 40mg 4 times daily for 2-3 days then 80mg thrice daily, begining 5-21 days after infarction.
Migraine prophylaxis- initially 40mg 2-3 times daily; maintenance 80-160mg daily.</p>

Complaints about bradycardia, dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms are less frequent. Despite its relative selectivity, atenolol can cause bronchospasms in asthma patients. Rarely observed side-effects are sleep disturbances, depression, paresthesiae, impotence, exanthema, psoriasis exacebations and arthropathies. Clinically relevant changes in the blood sugar have hardly occurred. There is no clarity as to the practical significance of the above mentioned changes in the lipid metabolism.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions:</strong> Poor cardiac reserve. Avoid in overt heart failure, anaesthesia and chronic obstructive airway disease or asthma. Withdrawal of beta-blocking drugs should be gradual in patients with ischaemic heart disease. Withdrawal of clonidine. 
 Co-administration with verapamil or class 1 antidysrhythmic agents modifies the tachycardia of hypoglycaemia. If symptoms attributable to slow heart rate reduce dose. In renal disese reduce dose.
(For more detail, see under the text of propranolol).<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation: </strong>Atenolol crosses the placenta. So it should not be given in pregnancy and lactation.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> By mouth:Hypertension, 50mg daily (higher doses no longer considered necessay)
Angina, 100mg daily in 1 or 2 doses Arrhythmias, 50-100 mg daily<br>
By intravenous injection:
Arrhythmias, 1.5 mg at a rate of 1mg/min, repeated at 5-minute intervals to a max. of 10mg.<br><br>

<strong>By intravenous infusion:</strong>
Arrhythmias, 150mcg/kg over 20 minutes, repeated every 12 hours if required.
Early intervention within 12 hours of
infarction, 5-10mg by slow i.v injection, then by mouth 50mg after 15 minutes, 50mg after 12 hours, then 100mg daily.<br><br>

<strong>Note:</strong> Excessive bradycardia can be countered with intravenous injection of atropine sulphate 0.6-2.4mg in divided doses of 0.6mg.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> The effects of other myocardial depressant agents, including anti-arrhythmics such as quinidine, procainamide, or lignocaine, phenytoin, and medicines which interfere with calcium transport, such as verapamil, may be enhanced by atenolol. The effects of atenolol are diminished by beta-adrenoceptor stimulating agents such as isoprenaline; the hypotensive effects of atenolol may be dangerously reversed and the peripheral vasoconstrictor effects enhaced by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating agents such as noradrenaline or those with mixed alpha-and beta-adrenoceptor stimulating properties such as adrenaline; bradycardia may also occur. The effects of atenolol may be enhanced by adrenergic neuron blocking agents such as guanethidine or bethanidine, or catecholamine-depleting agents such as reserpine and the hypotensive effects by diuretics. Atenolol may enhance some of the cardiac effects of digitalis and diminish others. It has been suggested that clonidine withdrawal symptoms may be exacerbated in patients who are concurrently taking a beta blocker.</p>

<h3> Bisoprolol Prescribing Notes </h3>

<strong>BISOPROLOL FUMARATE:</strong> Tablet Bisoprolol fumarate is a cardio-selective bl-adrenoceptor blocker. <br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> See under the text of propranolol.
<strong>Ind:</strong> Hypertension, angina pectoris & stable chronic moderate to severe heart failure (in addition to ACE inhibitors & diuretics).
<strong>C/I:</strong> Untreated cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock,sinoatrial block, second or third degree AV block, marked bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 beatper minute) or extreme hypotension.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Bisoprolol is well tolerated. Those reported are due to its pharmacological actions- lassitude, dizziness, mild headache, perspiration, aggravation of intermittent claudication or Raynaud's disease & paresthesia observed. Sleep disturbances only rarely reported.
<strong>Precaution:</strong> Use with care in patients with prolonged PR interval, poor cardiac reserve & peripheral circulatory disturbances, such as-Raynaud's phenomenon, chronic obstructive airways disease and diabetes. In patients with ischaemic heart disease, treatment should not be withdrawn abruptly.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Like other b-blockers, use only if essential. Safety in humans not established.<br><br>
<strong>Dosage:</strong> Hypertension & angina: Usually 5mg once daily; recommended range 5mg-10mg daily. Chronic heart failure: The treatment should be started with a small dose; the dose should be slowly & progressively up-titrated according to tolerance up to the maximum recommended dose of 10mg (if needed, please see detailed prescribing information in the text). In patients with final stage renal or liver disease, dose should not exceed to 10mg bisoprolol once daily. No dose adjustment required for the elderly.<br><br>

<strong>Child:</strong> Not recommended for children.
<strong>Drug Inter:</strong> May potentiate the effects of other cardiovascular agents, insulin or other oral hypoglycemic drugs. Rifampicin can reduce the half-life of bisoprolol.

    <h3> Carvedilol Prescribing Notes </h3>

    <p>  <strong>CARVEDILOL: Tablet</strong> <br> 
      It is a nonselective b-adrenergic receptor blocker, having an additional peripheral arteriolar vasodilator action by diverse mechanisms, and thus lower peripheral resitance. It also has antiproliferative properties and is a scavenger of reactive free oxidant radicals. It is used in the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris and congestive heart failure.<br> <br> 

      <strong>Ind:</strong> Treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris and mild or moderate (NYHA- New York Heart association class II or III) chronic congestive heart failure. In the treatment of heart failure, carvedilol is usually given in conjunction with diuretics, digitalis and ACE inhibitors. It may be used in patients unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor. Carvedilol may also be used in patients who are not receiving digitalis, hydralazine or nitrate therapy.<br><br>  
      
      <strong>C/I: </strong>Carvedilol is contraindicated in patients with NYHA class IV (New York Heart Association class IV) decompensated cardiac failure requiring intravenous inotropic therapy; bronchial asthma or related bronchospastic conditions; second or third- degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is placed); cardiogenic shock or severe bradycardia. Therapy is not to be initiated in severe heart failure.<br><br>  
      
      <strong>S/E:</strong> Postural hypotension, dizziness, headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances, bradycardia; occasionally diminished peripheral circulation, peripheral oedema and painful extremities, dry mouth, dry eyes, eye irritation or disturbed vision, impotence, disturbances of micturition, influenzae-like symptoms, rarely angina, AV block, exacerbation of intermittent claudication or Raynaud's phenomenon, allergic skin reactions, exacerbation of psoriasis, nasal stuffiness, wheezing, depressed mood, sleep disturbances, paresthesia, heart failure, changes in liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia are also reported.<br> <br> 
      
      <strong>Cautions:</strong> Take caution in hepatic impairment, and in heart failure, monitor clinical status for 2-3 hours after initiation and after increasing each dose. Before increasing dose ensure that the renal function and heart failure are not deteriorating. 

      <strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Carvedilol should not be used during pregnancy & breast- feeding, since no studies have been performed in pregnant & lactating women; animal studies have shown that carvedilol crosses the placental barrier & also excreted in breast milk. Safety and efficacy of carvedilol in neonates & children have not been established.<br><br>  
      
      <strong>Dosage:</strong> In hypertension- treatment should be started with 12.5mg once daily, then increased to 25mg daily after 2 days; the dose may further be increased to max. 50mg daily in single or divided doses, at intervals of at least 2 weeks, if necessary. In elderly patients, the initial dose of 12.5mg daily may be sufficient for adequate control.<br> <br> 
      
      In angina- initially 12.5mg twice daily, then increased to 25mg twice daily after 2 days. In heart failure- carvedilol may be given initially 3.125mg twice daily with food; dose may be increased at intervals of at least 2 weeks to 6.25mg twice daily, then to 12.5mg twice daily, then to 25mg twice daily. The dose may be increased to highest dose tolerated, in patients less than 85kg body-weight, max. 25mg twice daily and in patients over 85kg, max. 50mg twice daily.<br> <br> 
      
      <strong>Interactions:</strong> Digoxin- in normal healthy volunteers a single dose of carvedilol taken together with a single dose of digoxin resulted in significantly increased levels of digoxin 24- hour later. Patients with congestive heart failure stabilized on digoxin have been given carvedilol concomitantly without any adverse effects. Increased monitoring of digoxin is recommended when initiating, adjusting, or discontinuing the dose of carvedilol. Rifmapin-pretreatment with rifampin resulted in a 60% decrease in Cmax and AUC. Clonidine- b- receptor antagonists potentiate the pressor reaction which may follow sudden withdrawal of treatment with clonidine although, in theory, the a-blocking action of carvedilol should modify the pressure rise.<br> <br>

          <h3>Celiprolol Prescribing Notes   </h3>
          <p> <strong>CELIPROLOL HCI: Tablet</strong> <br><br>
Celiprolol is a betal-selective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent. It is available as celiprolol hydrochloride BP 200mg & 400mg tablet<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Celiprolol is a betal-selective (cardioselective), beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, which possesses mild beta2 agonist activity and weak alpha2-blocking activity, but does not exhibit quinidine-like membrane stabilizing properties. These and other receptor modulating effects may account for its absence of cardiodepressant effect, lack of adverse effects on serum lipids, decrease in peripheral vascular resistance as well as a reduced risk of adverse bronchopulmonary effects compared with other beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Celiprolol is indicated for the treatment of hypertension and effort-induced angina pectoris. <strong>C/I:</strong> All beta blockers are contraindicated in bronchial asthma or other obstructive lung disorders, uncontrolled heart failure, cardiogenic shock, sick-sinus syndrome, grade 2 and 3 A-V block, intranodal A-V block and severe bradycardia & also avoid in severe renal impairment.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Adverse effects are transient and mild. The most frequently observed are headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, weakness, rash, bradycardia, oedema, palpitation and muscle cramps; depression and pneumonitis reported rarely.<br><br>

 <strong>Precautions:</strong> Avoid abrupt withdrawal specially in angina; first-degree AV block; reduce oral dose of celiprolol in liver disease; renal impairment; diabetes; history of obstructive airways disease. Celiprolol therapy must be reported to the anaesthetist prior to general anaesthesia.<br><br>

 <strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Celiprolol in not teratogenic in experimental animals but is embryotoxic in rabbits and rats at 54 to 60 times the highest recommended human oral dose. It crosses the placenta in animals but is not known to what extent it crosses the placenta in human. So, it should not be given in pregnancy unless its use is considered to be essential. The extent to which celiprolol is excreted in breast milk has not been established therefore, breast-feeding should not be continued by mothers receiving this product. Dosage & admin: Hypertension: The recommended initial dose is 200mg once daily. The effect will be fully established after one to two weeks. The dose may be increased to 400mg once daily if necessary at 2 to 4 week intervals.<br><br>

<strong>Angina pectoris:</strong> It is indicated for the long- term management of patients with angina pectoris. The usual dose is 200mg once daily; dosage may be increased to 400mg or 600mg once daily after 2 to 4 weeks intervals until optimum clinical response obtained. If treatment is to discontinue, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. Celiprolol should be taken at least one hour before or two hours after meals.<br><br>  

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Verapamil and celiprolol both slow A-V conduction and depress myocardial contractility through different mechanisms. Therefore, clinical signs and ECG should be carefully monitored during the treatment with this combination particularly when initiating therapy. The bioavailability of celiprolol has been shown to be reduced by the concomitant administration of chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide or theophylline. While no effect on the efficacy of celiprolol has been demonstrated, patients response should be monitored after dosage adjustments involving these medications.   </p>

  <h3> TERAZOSIN Prescribing Notes </h3>
  <p>  
<strong>TERAZOSIN HCI: Tablet</strong> <br><br>
Terazosin hydrochloride is a selective
a-1 adrenoceptor competitive blocking agent with a longer duration of action. It is a quinazoline derivative. When it is taken orally, it is absorbed very rapidly & action started within 15 minutes of ingestion.<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action :</strong> See above under the text of
alpha adrenoceptor blocking drugs.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Mild to moderate hypertension. In benign prostatic hyperplasia, single therapy is useful to relieve signs and symptoms.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Known to be hypersensitive to terazosin or
its analogues.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Dizziness, lack of energy, peripheral oedema; urinary frequency and priapism reported. Cautions: First dose may cause collapse due to hypotension (within 30-90 minutes, therefore should be taken on retiring to bed), may also occur with rapid dose increase. Caution should also be observed when terazosin is administered with other antihypertensive agents, avoid the possibility of significant hypotension. When adding terazosin to a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent, dosage reduction and adjustment may be necessary. In case of initiation of terazosin therapy patients should be cautioned
to avoid driving & hazardous tasks, where injury could result due to syncope.<br><br>

<strong>Use in pregnancy & lactation: </strong>Terazosin is not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit overweighs the potential risk to mother & foetus. As terazosin is excreted in the breast milk, caution should also be exercised when administered in nursing mother.<br><br>

<strong>Dose:</strong> Hypertension, initial dose- 1mg at bedtime (compliance with bedtime dose .important, see cautions); dose can be increased or doubled after 7 days if necessary; usual maintenance dose- 2-10mg once daily; more than 20mg daily rarely improves efficacy. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, initial dose- 1mg at bedtime is starting dose of all patients and this dose should not be exceeded; subsequent dose- the dose slowly increases to achieve the desired response, the usual recommended dose range is 5-10mg once daily. </p>

          <h3>  Prescribing Notes </h3>
<p> Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors include: Captopril, Cilazapril, Enalapril, Fosinopril, Imidapril, Lisinopril, Moexipril, Perindopril, Quinapril, Ramipril &Trandolapril. <br><br>

<strong>mode of action</strong>: Angiotensin converting enzyme or ACE inhibitors inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotension II. They are effective and generally well tolerated.<br><br>

<strong>Indications:</strong>

Hypertension: ACE inhibitors are usually considered in hypertension when thiazides and betablockers are contra-indicated, not tolerated, or failed to control blood pressure; they are particularly indicated for hypertension in insulin dependent diabetics with nephropathy.<br><br>

Heart failure: ACE inhitiotrs have a valuable role in all grades of heart failure, combined when appropriate with diuretic and digoxin treatment. Myocardial infarction: ACE inhibotors are used in the immediate and long term management of patients who have had a myocardial infarction. Diabetic nephropathy: It is recommended that all diabetic patients with nephropathy causing albuminuria and all insulin-dependent diabetic patients with established microalbuminuria should be treated with an ACE inhibitor even if the blood pressure is normal.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Hypersensitivity to ACE inhibitors; known or suspected renovascular disease (unless the blood pressure cannot be controlled by other drugs); aortic stenosis; pregnancy; porphyria.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Hypotension, dizziness,headache, fatigue, asthenia, nausea (or occasionally vomiting), diarrhoea, muscle cramps, persistent dry cough, throat discomfort, voice changes, taste alteration, stomatitis, dyspepsia,abdominal pain, renal impariment, hyperkalaemia, angioedema, urticaria, rashes and hypersensitivity reactions; blood disorders (e.g agranulocytosis, neutropenia); other side-effects reported include upper respiratory symptoms, hyponatraemia, tachycardia, palpitations, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction and CVD, back pain, flushing, jaundice, pancreatitis, sleep disturbances, nervousness, mood changes, paraesthesia,
impotence, alopecia.<br><br>

<strong>Cautions:</strong> Renal function and electrolytes should be checked before starting ACE inhibitors and monitored during treatment. Caution with diuretics as the first dose may cause hypotension, because ACE inhibitors can cause rapid fall of blood pressure in volume depleted patients, therefore if possible, any diuretic should be discontinued or the dose reduced significantly 2-3 days before initiation of an ACE inhibitor. Diuretic therapy may be resumed if necessary after a few weeks.
Patients with renal impairment, S.L.E & other autoimmune collagen disorders & during concurrent use of immunosuppressant or leukopenic drugs monitor WBC counts & urinary protein before & during therapy. Lactation. Anaesthesia.<br><br>
<strong>Dosage:</strong> See under the text of the individual preparation.   </p>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Essential an renovascular hypertension; in the treatment of chronic or congestive heart failure as an adjunctive therapy with digitalis and/or diuretics.

<strong>C/I; S/E; Caution:</strong> See above under the text of ACE inhibitor.
Dosage & admin: Essential hypertension, initially 1mg once daily; if used in those receiving a diuretic, in elderly, or in renal impairment, initially 500mcg once daily; in renovascular hypertension, liver cirrhosis, initially 250-500mcg once daily; usual maintenace dose 1-2.5mg once daily; maximum 5mg daily.

<strong>Heart failure</strong>, initially 500mcg once daily under close medical supervision, increased to 1mg once daily; usual maintenance dose 1-2.5mg dialy; max. 5mg daily.

<strong>Note:</strong> In patients receiving diuretics, cilazapril therapy should be initiated with caution, since they are usually volume depleted and more likely to cause hypotension following ACE inhibitor. Whenever possible, all diuretics should he discontinued two to three days prior to the administration of cilazapril. If this is not possible, due to patient's condition, cilazapril should be started at 0.5mg once daily and the blood pressure closely monitored after the first dose until it is stabilized.   </p>

          <h3> Prescribing Notes  </h3>
          <p> RAMIPRIL: Tablet
Ramipril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which after
hydrolysis to ramiprilat, blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasocons-trictor substance, angiotensin II. So, inhibition of ACE by ramipril results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Thus, ramipril exerts its antihypertensive activity. It is long acting and well tolerated; so, can be used in long term therapy.

<strong>Ind: </strong>
i. Mild to severe hypertension, where it may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. 
ii. Congestive heart failure.
iii. To reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular events in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. iv. Proteinuric non-diabetic nephropathy. 

<strong>C/I; S/E; Caution:</strong> See above under the text of ACE inhibitor.

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Dosage of Rmaipril must be adjusted according to the patient tolerance and response.

<strong>Hypertension</strong>- For the management of hypertension in adults not receiving a diuretic, the usual initial dose is 1.25-2.5mg once daily. Dosage generally is adjusted no more rapidly than at 2-week intervals. The usual maintenance dosage in adults is 2.5-20mg daily given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses daily. If BP is not controlled with Ramipril alone, a diuretic may be added.

<strong>Congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction</strong>- In this case, Ramipril therapy may be initiated as early as 2 days after myocardial infarction. An initial dose of 2.5mg twice daily is recommended, but if hypotension occurs, dose should be reduced to 1.25mg twice daily. Therapy is then adjusted to a target daily dose of 5mg twice daily.

<strong>Prevention of major cardiovascular events</strong>- In this case, the recommended dose is 2.5mg twice daily for the first week of therapy and 5mg once daily for the following 3 weeks; dosage then may be increased, as tolerated to a maintenance dosage of 10mg once daily. Dosage in renal impairment- For the patients with hypertension and renal impairment, the recommended initial dose is 1.25mg once daily. Subsequent dosage should be adjusted according to individual tolerance and BP response, up to a maximum of 5mg daily. For the patients with heart failure and renal impairment, the recommended dose is 1.25mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25mg twice daily and up to a maximum dose of 2.5mg twice daily depending upon clinical response and tolerability.

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Concomitant administration with diuretics may lead to serious hypotension and in addition dangerous hyperkalemia with potassium sparing diuretics. Concomitant therapy with lithium may increase the serum lithium concentration. Reduction in BP may affect the ability to drive and operate machinery and this may be exacerbated by alcohol. NSAIDs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Ramipril and cause deterioration of renal function. Overdosage: Limited data on human overdosage  are available. The most likely clinical manifestations would be symptoms attributable to hypotension. Because the hypotensive effect of Ramipril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat Ramipril overdosage by infusion of normal saline solution. </p>

          <h3> Prescribing Notes  </h3>
          <p><strong> Introduction:</strong> The angiotensin-II receptor blockers are newer antihypertensive drugs, act by blocking the action of angiotensin-II on the heart, peripheral vasculature and kidney. They are also useful in the management of heart failure.
The angiotensin-II receptor blockers that known to us till this day are- Losartan, Valsartan & very recently introduced are- Candesartan, Eprosartan, Irbesartan and Telmisartan <br><br>

<strong>mode of action</strong>: Angiotensin-II is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. The angiotensin-II receptor blockers block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secreting effects of angiotensin-II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin-II. They have many properties & effects similar to those of the ACE inhibitors; hut their merit over ACE inhibitors that they do not inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin and other kinins, thus they do not cause persistent dry cough as happens with ACE inhibitors.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Hypertension; congestive heart-failure & renal arterial stenosis.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Hypersensitivity to any of the components of angiotensin-II receptor blocking preparations, e.g losartan, valsartan etc. Contra-indicated in pregnancy & lactation, if pregnancy is detected during therapy should be discontinued as soon as possible.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> The side-effects that experienced with angiotensin-II blockers are mild and rare. For specific side-effects see below under individual preparation.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Sodium-depleted and/or volume-depleted patients, such as, those receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur in rare cases after initiation of therapy. Sodium and/or volume depletion should be corrected before starting treatment with angiotensin-II receptor blockers for example, by reducing the diuretic dose. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed
in the supine position and, if necessary, given an i.v infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once the blood pressure has stablised. Dosage: See below under the text of individual products.   </p>

          <h3>Prescribing Notes   </h3>
          <p> CANDESARTAN: Tablet<br><br>
Candesartan cilexetil is a newer angiotensin-II receptor blocker. It is rapidly and completely bioactivated by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract to candesartan, a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist.<br><br>

<strong>mode of action</strong>: See above under the text of 'angiotensin-II receptor blocker'.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> It is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.<br><br> 

<strong>C/I:</strong> Pregnancy. Known hypersensitivity to any component of this product.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Body as a whole: Asthenia, fever.
Central & peripheral nervous system: Paresthesia, vertigo. Gastrointestinal system: Dyspepsia, gastroenteritis.
Cardiovascular system: Tachycardia, palpitation. Metabolic & nutritional: Creatine phosphokinase increased, hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia.
Musculoskeletal system: Myalgia. Platelet/bleeding-clotting disorders: Epistaxis. Psychiatric disorders: Anxiety, depression, somnolence.
Skin & appendages: Rash, sweating increased. Urinary system: Hematuria.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & Warmings:</strong> See above under the text of 'angiotensin-II receptor blocker'. <br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> When pregnancy is detected candesartan should be discontinued as soon as possible. It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk, but has been shown to be present in rat milk. Therefore, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Dosage & admin: Dosage must be individualized. Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2mg to 32mg. The usual recommended starting dose is 16mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. Candesartan can be administered once or twice daily with total daily dosage ranging from 8mg to 32mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with candesartan.
No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients, for patients with mildly impaired renal function, or for patients with mildly impaired hepatic function. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), candesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to administration of a lower dose. Candesartan may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by candesartan alone, a diuretic can be added. Candesartan may be administered with other antihyper-tensive agents.
Paediatric patients: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 

<strong>Drug Inter:</strong> No significant interactions have been reported with other drugs such as glyburide, nifedipine, digoxin, warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide and oral contraceptives in healthy volunteers. Because candesartan is not metabolised by the cytochrome P 450 system and has no effect on P 450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit, or are metabolised by, those enzymes could not be expected.   </p>

          <h3> Prescribing Notes  </h3>
          <p>  IRBESARTAN: Tablet<br><br>
Irbesartan is an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, introduced very recently for the treatment of hypertension. It is available as irbesartan INN 75mg, 150mg & 300mg/tablet.<br><br>
<strong>Ind:</strong> lrbesartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.<br><br>
<strong>S/E:</strong> Adverse events in patients receiving irbesartan are generally mild and transient with no relationship to dose.
Cardiovascular: Uncommon- subjective rhythm disturbance, flushing, ECG abnormality, cardiac murmur, cardiac rhythm disturbance, orthostatic hypotension, atrial rhythm disturbance, bradycardia, hypotension; Rare- syncope, conduction disorder, myocardial infarction. Dermatologic: Uncommon- pruritus, facial erythema; Rare- dermatitis, acne, scalp-hair abnormality. Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte imbalance: Uncommon- sexual dysfunction, libido change; Rare- breast disorder, gout, hot flashes. Gastrointestinal: Unommon- constipation, flatulance, dry mouth, abdomen distention; Rare- abnormal stool, decreased or increased appetite, oral lesion, dysphagia, oesophagitis. General: Uncommon- weakness, hyperhidrosis, malaise, weight gain; Rare- cold sensation, warmth sensation, pain. Haematopoietic: Rare- anaemia. Musculoskeletal/connective tissue: Uncommon- muscle cramp, swelling extremity; Rare- arthritis, muscleache, myalgia, extremity weakness, stiffness of lower extremity. Nervous system: Uncommon- orthostatic dizziness, numbness, sleep disturbance, depression, emotion labile/disturbance, somnolence, vertigo, paresthesia; Rare- stress related disorder, tremor coordination disturbance, disturbing dreams. Renal/Genitourinary: Uncommon- urination abnormality. Respiratory: Uncommon- epistaxis, dyspnea. Special senses: Uncommon- vision disturbance, hearing abnormality; Rare- eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, visual field abnormality, medication bad taste, taste disturbance.
Others: As with other angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, angioedema) have been reported since the marketing of irbesartan. The following have been reported very rarely during post-marketing surveillance: arthralgia, asthenia, hyperkalemia, myalgia, tinnitus jaundice, elevated liver function tests and impaired renal function including isolated cases of renal failure in patients at risk.<br><br>

<strong>C/I; Precautions & Warnings:</strong> See above under the text. The safety of irbesartan in the presence of heart failure has not been fully defined. Sudden death has occurred in some studies of patients with heart failure, and although such deaths may have reflected the natural history of the underlying heart failure, caution is recommended when treating such patients with irbesartan. At this time, experience is limited with irbesartan in the treatment of patients with ventricular dysfunction or cardiac arrythmias; caution is advised.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. lrbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats, but not known whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. So, a decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of irbesartan in the therapy of the mother and the potential risk to the infant.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin: </strong>Irbesartan may be used either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents (e.g thiazide diuretic, beta-adrenergic blocking agent, long-acting calcium-channel blocking agent). The usual initial and maintenance dose of irbesartan is 150mg once daily. It may be administered with or without food. Therapy should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. Patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, dose may be increased to 300mg once daily. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with irbesartan alone, a diuretic (e.g hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg daily) or another antihypertensive drug (e.g beta-adrenergic blocking agent, long-acting calcium channel blocking agent) may be added.
Patients with intravascular volume depletion: Volume and/or sodium-depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with irbesartan or a lower starting dose (e.g 75mg) should be considered. Patients undergoing haemodialysis should receive a starting dose of 75mg, and the dose should be adjusted according to B.P response. If the blood
pressure is not adequately controlled, the dose can be increased.
Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established. Elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment: No dosage reductions is generally necessary in the elderly or in patients with impaired hepatic function (mild to moderate degree) or impaired renal function (regardless of degree), unless accompanied by uncorrected volume depletion.
Irbesartan is contra-indicated in those patients who are hypersensitive to irbesrtan.<br><br>

<strong>Drug Inter:</strong> No interactions would be expected to occur with drugs whose metabolism is dependent upon cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Irbesartan is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9, however, during clinical studies, no significant drug interactions were observed when irbesartan was co-administered with warfarin (a drug metabolized by CYP2C9). Irbesartan does not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan is not affected by co-administration with nifedipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin- angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increase in serum potassium. Reversible increases in lithium concentra-tions have been very rarely reported with irbesartan. Therefore, if co- administration of irbesartan and lithium proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium is necessary.  </p>

          <h3> Prescribing Notes  </h3>
          <p>  LOSARTAN POTASSIUM: Tablet<br><br>
It is an angiotensin-II receptor (type AT1) antagonist, & now regarded as the first-line therapy option for treating high blood pressure. <br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> All grades of hypertension, congestive heart- failure & renal arterial stenosis. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. It is an effective alternative for patients who have to discontinue an ACE inhibitor because of persistent dry cough. <br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> The side-effects that experienced with losartan are usually mild and occasional. Symptomatic hypotension may occur, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g those treating with diureics). Hyperkalaemia may occur occasionally. Other side-effects may include- diarrhoea, dizziness, myalgia, migraine, urticaria, pruritus, taste disturbance, upper respiratory infection, leg pain & altered liver function tests.<br><br>

<strong>C/I; Cautions; Warnings:</strong> See above under the text.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & Admin:</strong> The usual starting dose is 50mg once daily; but, in patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g patients treated with diuretics), patients with a history of hepatic or renal impairment & in case of very elderly patients (over 75 years) should be started with 25mg once daily. It can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 25mg to increasing upto 100mg after several weeks, if necessary. If blood pressure is not controlled by losartan alone, a diuretic may be added at a low dose. Losartan may be administered with or without food.<br><br>
<strong>Children:</strong>- not recommended.<br><br>
<strong>Drug Inter:</strong> Losartan potassium, as with other drugs that block angiotensin II or its effects, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium.
Besides, no significant drug interactions have been identified by clinical trials with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin,cimetidine, ketoconazole and phenobarbital.  </p>

<strong>Precautions & warnings: </strong>Sodium and/or volume depleted patients, such as, those receiving high doses of
diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur in rare cases after initiation of
therapy. Sodium and/or volume depletion should be corrected before starting treatment with valsartan; (for example, by reducing the diuretic dose). If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an i.v infusion of normal saline. Treatment can be continued once the blood pressure has stablised.

  <h3> SODIUM NITROPRUSSIDE Inj. DBL/Globex  </h3>
  <p>  Sodium nitroprusside dihydrate B.P 50mg/5ml vial: Injection for i.v infusion.SODIUM NITROPRUSSIDE Inj. DBL/Globex<br><br>
<strong>Ind:</strong> Immediate reduction of blood pressure in patients with hypertensive crisis. Concomitant oral antihypertensive medication should be started while the hypertensive emergency is being brought under control with sodium nitroprusside. Producing controlled hypotension during anaesthesia in order to reduce bleeding in surgical procedures.
Short term therapy of cardiac failure. Patients should be commenced on oral therapy as soon as
possible.<br><br>
<strong>C/I:</strong> It should not be used in the treatment of compensatory hypertension.
It is also contraindicated in physically poor-risk patients, uncorrected anemia or hypovolemia, known inadequate erebral circulation, severe renal disease or disease states associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and in congenital (Leber's) optic atrophy or tobacco amblyopia.<br><br>
<strong>S/E:</strong> Most important side-effects are- excessive hypotension and cyanide toxicity. Others- methemoglobinemia, thiocyanate toxicity, nausea, retching, diaphoresis, apprehension, headache, restlessness, muscle twitching, retrosternal discomfort, palpitation, dizziness, drowsiness, paraesthesia warmth, abdominal pain, tachycardia, postural hypotension, bradycardia, electrocardiographic changes, dermatological irritation, rash and flushing, reddening of skin at the injection site and venous streaking, symptoms of hypothyroidism, decreased platelets aggregation and raised intracranial pressure. Warnings: Only to be used as an infusion with sterile 5% glucose in water. It should not be administered by direct injection.
The principal hazards of sodium nitroprusside administration are excessive hypotension and accumulation of cyanide.<br><br>
<strong>Precautions:</strong> Use with extreme caution in patients whose intracranial pressure is already elevated, with hepatic insufficiency, hypothyroidism, severe renal dysfunction, and patients who are of specially poor surgical risk.
Pre-existing anemia nad hypovolemia should be corrected prior to administration.
Direct monitoring of blood pressure is mandatory. Patients should remain recumbent during the infusion.
When the solution shows coloured reaction, it should be replaced.<br><br>
<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> It is not known if sodium nitroprusside is harmful to the foetus or infants. Therefore, it should only be given to pregnant or nursing women when the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk.
Dosage & admin: Infusion should be started at a very low rate of 3mg/kg/min. with upward titration every few minutes until the desired effect achieved. The maximum recommended infusion rate is 10mg/kg/min.
The reconstituted solution should only be infused by infusion pump, micro-drip regulator. Care should be taken to avoid extravasation. Do not admix with other drugs. Overdosage: Overdosage can be manifested as excessive hypotension, cyanide or thiocyanate toxicity.<br><br>
<strong>Drug Inter:</strong> Ganglion blocking agents and other antihypertensive agents, volatile liquid anaesthetics, inhaled anaesthetics, negative inotropics and most other circulatory depressants potentiate its hypotensive action.
The transition from sodium nitroprusside to oral antihypertensive therapy may predispose to severe, sudden hypotension.
Note: For further information, please consult manufacturer's literature.

          <h3> HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE: Tablet  </h3>
          <p>  Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. It is available as hydrochlorothiazide BP 25mg & 50mg/tablet.
: Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium.<br><br>
<strong>Ind:</strong> Oedema, hypertension.<br><br>
<strong>C/I:</strong> Anuria, lactation, severe renal failure.<br><br>
<strong>S/E:</strong> Rashes, thrombocytopenia.<br><br>
<strong>Cautions:</strong> May cause hypokalemia; aggravates diabetes and gout; renal and hepatic impairment <br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Adult: Diuresis, 50-100mg once or twice daily or intermittently. Hypertension, initially 50-100mg daily as a single or divided doses, max. 200mg daily. Child: Under 6 months upto 3.5mg/kg body- wt. daily; 6 months to 2 yrs. 12.5-37.5mg daily; 2-12 yrs. 37.5-100mg daily. All in two divided doses.<br><br>
<strong>Drug Inter:</strong> Hydrochlorothiazide, when administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics, such as alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics; these may cause potentiation of orthostatic hypotension. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)- dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may
be required.
Other antihypertensive drugs-additive effect or potentiation.
Cholestyramine and colestipol resins- absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins.
Corticosteroids, ACTH- intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.
Skeletal muscle relaxants, tubocurarine- possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium- diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
NSAID can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium- sparing and thiazide duretics.  </p>

          <h3> General Prescribing Notes  </h3>
          <p>  There are four diuretic agents, which are playing their major role on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, known as loop diuretics. These are- Bumetanide, Frusemide, Torasemide & Ethacrynic acid
Loop diuretics are the most effective drugs & are more useful in emergency manegment of acute edematous conditions, such as acute pulmonary edema.<br><br>
<strong>mode of action</strong>: Loop diuretics act on the lumen of thick ascending limb of loop of Henle, inhibit the Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport & thus decreasing reabsorption of Na+, K+, and Cl-. This leads to remove excess water from the body. It does not significantly alter glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or acid-base balance. Loop diuretics also increase the Ca++ content of urine, while thiazide diuretics decrease.

          <h3> FRUSEMIDE + SPIRONOLACTONE Prescribing Notes  </h3>
          <p> 
FRUSEMIDE + SPIRONOLACTONE: Tablet
This is a combination of two diuretics, viz: Frusemide, a short-acting loop-diuretic and spironolactone, a long-acting aldosterone antagonist, potassium-sparing diuretic. This combination produces synergistic or additive diuretic effects.<br><br>
<strong>mode of action</strong>: Frusemide inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transport in the ascending limb of loop of henle and blocks the reabsorption of electrolytes (Na+, K+ and Cl- ions) and water. Spironolactone inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium at the distal tubule by blocking the action of aldosterone. So the excretion of sodium is increased and the excess loss of potassium, induced by the frusemide is decreased.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> i. Essential hypertension, ii. Chronic congestive heart failure, iii. Ascites of liver cirrhosis, iv. Edema (swelling due to excess fluid retention), v. Hyperaldosteronism, and vi. Resistant oedema associated with secondary hyperaldosteronism.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> This combination is contraindicated in patients with acute renal failure, renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30ml/min), anuric states, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, Addison's disease; patients with hypersensitivity to frusemide, spironolactone or sulphonamide. 
<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Generally, this combined preparation is well tolerated. However, a few side effects like fatigue, nausea, vomiting, malaise or gastric upset, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, headache, hypotension, skin rash may be seen which disappears after withdrawal of the drug. Besides these, irregular menstrual cycle, impotence, gynecomastia rarely may occur.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions:</strong> Caution should be taken in patients liable to electrolyte deficiency. This preparation should also be used with caution in diabetes, enlarged prostate, hypotension and in hypovolemia.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Frusemide is safe in pregnancy but spironolactone may cross the placental barrier. So, it should be used in pregnancy only if strictly indicated & for short- term treatment and if expected benefits to the mother is greater than the possible risk to the fetus.
This combined preparation is excreted into the breast milk, so it is contraindicated in lactating mother.
Dosage & admin: 1 to 4 tablets daily according to the patients response or as directed by the physician.<br><br>

<strong>Children:</strong> Not recommended.<br><br>

<strong>Drug Inter:</strong> Precautions should be taken while co-administration with the following drugs: ACE inhibitors, nephrotoxic & ototoxic antibiotics, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, carbenoxolone and sucralfate.   </p>

          <h3> ATENOLOL + AMLODIPINE: Tablet  </h3>
          <p> A fixed-dose combinations of atenolol and amlodipine are available for the treatment of hypertension alone or in co-existance with ischemic heart dease. The fixed-dose combinations are: i. atenolol 25mg + amlodipine 5mg and ii. atenolol 50mg + amlodipine 5mg. Amlodipine besilate is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and atenolol is a phenylacetamide, a selective b1 blocker.<br><br>
          
          <strong>mode of action</strong>: Given under the text of atenolol and amlodipine separately.<br><br>
          
          <strong>Ind:</strong> i. Hypertension not controlled by monotherapy, ii. angina pectoris & hypertension as co-existing diseases, iii. post-MI patients, iv.refractory angina pectoris where nitrate has failed. <br><br>

          <strong>S/E:</strong> Given under the text of atenolol and amlodipine separately.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Amlodipine is contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to dihydropyridines. It should not be used in cardiogenic shock, clinically significant aortic stenosis, unstable angina (excluding Prinzmetal's angina).
Atenolol is contraindicated with a known hypersensitivity to atenolol, severe bradycardia, second or third degree heart block, uncontrolled heart failure, hypotension, severe peripheral vascular disease (including intermittent claudication), sick sinus syndrome, cardiogenic shock, phaeocromocytoma (without a concomitant alpha blocker), metabolic acidosis.
<br><br>


<strong>Precautions:</strong> Renal impairment: The combination can be used in patients with renal impairment. However, caution may be necessary if the creatinine clearance is less than 30ml/min because of possible reduction in the excretion of unchanged atenolol. Hepatic impairment: Caution may be necessary in the use of the combination in patients with severe liver damage because of prolongation of the elimination halflife of amlodipine. Bronchospasm: The combination should be used with caution in patients with airway obstruction. Drug withdrawal: Since coronary heart disease may exist without being recognised, patients should be warned against stopping the drug suddenly. Any discontinuation should be gradual and under observation.
<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong>
Atenolol crosses the placenta. On the other hand, the use of amlodipine in pregnancy and lactation has yet not been established. So, the combination is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation. Dosage & admin: The recommended dosage is one tablet of amlodipine 5mg and atenolol 25mg or 50mg daily. Depending upon the therapeutic response, titration of the dosage is recommended. If necessary, the dosage may be doubled to two tablets daily. In elderly patients, it is advisable to initiate the therapy with lower dosage, such as, amlodipine 2.5mg and atenolol 25mg daily.<br><br>

<strong>Drug Inter:</strong> Given under the text of atenolol and amlodipine separately.

          <h3> Prescribing Notes  </h3>
          <p>  This is a combination preparation of atenolol and chlorthalidone. Atenolol is a selective (cardiose- lective) beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-type oral diuretic with prolonged action. The combination of atenolol & chlorthalidone offers complementary mechanisms of action with additive or synergistic effects and better tolerability.This combination is available in 2 fixed presenta- tions, viz: i. tablet containing atenolol BP 50mg & chlorthalidone USP 25mg, ii. tablet containing atenolol BP 100mg and chlorthalidone USP 25mg. 
          	<br><br>

          <strong>mode of action</strong>: Atenolol is a cardioselective 131- adrenergic receptor blocker. In the heart atenolol binds with the 131 receptors and antagonizes epinephrine/norepinephrine, thus it blocks the adrenergic stimulation of heart muscles and decreases cardiac output. The diuretic action of chlorthalidone occurs within 2 hours of an oral dose. It produces diuresis by increasing excretion of sodium and chloride, plus inhibiting reabsorption of sodium and water in the tubules. In this way, the action of chlorthalidone also results in decrease in cardiac output. The antihypertensive effects of these two agents are additive or synergistic.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> This combination is indicated in the
treatment of hypertension.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> This combination is contraindicated in hypersensitivity to this product or to sulfonamide- derived drugs. It is also contraindicated in patients with sinus bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure and anuria.
<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Atenolol and chlorthalidone combination is usually well tolerated. Most adverse effects have been mild and transient. However dizziness, fatigue, vertigo, nausea, diarrhea and bradycardia have been reported rarely.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Atenolol and chlorthalidone combination should be given with caution to patients with severe renal impairment, uncontrolled heart failure, impaired hepatic function or liver disease. In patients receiving thiazides, sensitivity reactions may occur with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. The possible exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported. The antihypertensive effects of thiazides may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient. Use in elderly: Clinical studies of atenolol & cholrthalidone combination did not include sufficient mumbers of sunjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Atenolol & chlorthalidone combination can cause harm to the developing fetus and may appear in breast milk. So, it should not be given during pregnancy & lactation.
Dosage & admin: Dosage of this combination must be individualized.
The initial dose should be one tablet (atenolol 50mg + chlorthalidone 25mg) given once a day. <br><br>

<strong>Drug Inter:</strong> Atenolol and chlorthalidone combination may potentiate the action of other antihypertensives, such as clonidine, diltiazem. Prostaglandin synthetase inhibiting drugs e.g indomethacin may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers. This combination should not be given with lithium due to high risk of lithium toxicity.
Storage: Store in a cool, dry place. Protect from light.

          <h3> Prescribing Notes  </h3>
          <p>   This is a fixed combination preparation of benazepril and amlodipine. The products are available as capsules in three presentations: i. capsule contaning benazepril hydrochloride USP 10mg and amlodipine besylate BP equivalent to amlodipine 2.5mg; ii. capsule contaning benazepril hydrochloride USP 10mg and amlodipine besylate BP equivalent to amlodipine 5mg; iii. capsule contaning benazepril hydrochloride USP 20mg and amlodipine besylate BP equivalent to amlodipine 5mg.<br><br>

<strong>mode of action</strong>: Benazepril inhibits angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE). This ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angitensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and aldosterone secretion. Mechanism through which benazepril lowers blood pressure is belived to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist which inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth
muscle and cardiac muscle. It has greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine causes a preipheral arterial vasodilatation that leads to reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> This combination product is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, where monotherapy is not sufficient.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Known hypersensitivity to benazepril, to any other ACE inhibitor, or to amlodipine.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Cough, headache, dizziness, and edema; persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, and always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to the drugs are- angioedema, asthenia and fatigue, insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, tremor; dry mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and esophagitis; hypokalemia, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, cramps; polyuria, decreased libido, impotence etc. <br><br>

<strong>Precautions:</strong> Impaired renal function: When the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is inhibited by benazepril, changes in renal function may be anticipated in severe renal disease. Treatment with benazepril was associated with increases in blood urea and serum creatinine in hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis. Hyperkalemia: Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes.
Patients with congestive heart failure: In general, all calciun channel blockers should be used with caution in patients with heart failure. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with ACE inhibitors (including benazepril) may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure. Patitnts with hepatic failure: Since amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, caution should be exercised when administering amlodipine and benazepril to patients with severe hepatic impairment.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Caution should be exercised in first trimester of pregnancy categories C and in second and third trimesters of pregnancy categories D.
Although it is not known whether amlodipine is excreted in human, but, minimal amounts of unchanged benazepril is excreted into the breast milk of lactating mothers, so, it is recommended that nursing should be discontinued while amlodipine and benazepril combined preparations are administered.
Dosage & admin: Amlodipine and benazepril combination therapy to be given once daily. Usual dose: In this combination therapy amlodipine doses range from 2.5mg to 10mg and benazepril doses range from 10mg to 20mg; the physician can initiate the therapy with any fixed combination as preferred; the antihypertensive effect can be increased by increasing and adjusting the doses of amlodipine and/or benazepril in all patient groups. From this combination therapy all patients are benefited from the reduction in amlodipine-induced edema.<br><br>

<strong>Children:</strong> Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.<br><br>

<strong>Drug Inter:</strong> Diuretics: patients on diuretics may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with amlodipine and benazepril. Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g spironolactone) or potassium supplement can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Lithium: Increased serum lithium level and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium.
