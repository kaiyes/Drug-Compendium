          <h3>HALOTHANE: Inhalation anaesthetic </h3>
          <p>  Halothane is a most widely used inhalation anaesthetic.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> For induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia in major surgery with oxygen or nitrous oxide-oxygen mixtures.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> History of unexplained jaundice or pyrexia after a previous exposure to halothane is an absolute contraindication to its future use in that patient. Halothane is contraindicated in patients with known, or suspected, genetic predisposition to malignant byperpyrexia.<br><br>

 <strong>S/E & Cautions:</strong> Cardio-respiratory depression, bradycardia, fall of arterial pressure. Halothane can induce liver damage, therefore, any changes or disturbances of liver function including jaundice and enzyme activity (serum aminotransferase), usually following repeated administrations (within 4-6 wks), should be monitored & in the case of hepatic impairment, an alternative agent should be used if necessary in this period.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> Halothane should be used with care in obstetrics as uterine relaxation and post-partum haemorrhage may result. In early pregnancy, it is better to avoid unless its use is essential. In case of nursing mother, breast feeding should be with-held for about 24 hours after halothane anaesthsia.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Using a suitable vaporiser, for induction of anaesthesia in the adult patient, a concentration of 2-4% halothane in oxygen or oxygen/nitrous oxide may be used. In children, a concentation of 1.5-2% halothane in oxygen or oxygen/nitrous oxide is used. A concentration of 0.5-2G is usually adequate for manintenance of anaesthesia in both adults and children. The lower concentration is usually most suitable for elderly patients.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Cardiac arrhythmias may occur when adrenaline is used concurrently. All commonlyused muscle relaxants may be used in conjunction with halothane, but, as halothane potentiates the actions of gallamine and d-tubocurarine, the doses of these muscle relaxants must be reduced. The association of d-tubocurarine with halothane may lead to a marked fall in blood pressure. Potentiation occurs between halothane and hypotensive agents, such as pentolinium and trimetaphan. These drugs must not be used in reduced dosagewhen administered in conjunction with halothane.The use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists during halothane anaesthesia is at the discretion of the anaesthetist.<br><br>

          <h3> ISOFLURANE: Inhalation Anaesthetic  </h3>
          <p>Isoflurane is a colorless non-flammable general inhalation anaesthetic which contains no additive or stabiliser. It is 1-chloro 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> General inhalation anaesthetic for use in induction and maintenance.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Known sensitivity to isoflurane or to other halogenated agents. Isoflurane should never be given to patients with known or suspected susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. Isoflurane must not be used in patients who have developed an icterus and/or fever of unknown origin, hepatic impairment or eosinophilia after administration of isoflurane or another halogenated anaesthetic.
<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Adverse reactions encountered with isoflurane are similar to those observed with other halogenated anaesthetics; these are hypotension, respiratory depression and arrhythmias.Other minor side effects encountered while using isoflurane are an increase in the white blood cell count (even in the absence of surgical stress) and also shivering, nausea and vomiting during the postoperative period. These side effects are only observed in a similar number of patietns to other anaesthetics.Increase in heart rate has been reported.Rare cases of bronchospasm have been reported. During marketing there have been rare reports of mild, moderate and severe (some fatal) post- operative hepatic dysfunction. The causal relationship is unknown.<br><br>

Pre<strong>Cautions:</strong> Isoflurane has got a profound respiratory depressant action, this effect is being accentuated by narcotic premedication or concurrent use of other respiratory depressants. Isoflurane causes an increase in cerebral blood flow at deeper levels of anaesthesia, (1.5%), and this may give rise to an increase in cerebral spinal fluid pressure. Where appropriate, this can be prevented or reversed by hyper-ventilating the patient before or during anaesthesia. As with other halogenated anaesthetics, isoflurane must be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure. Again, in such cases, hyperventilation may be necessary.
As with all halogenated anaesthetics, repeat anaesthesia within a short period of time should be approached with caution since the risk of hepatotoxicity is not fully understood. There is insufficient experience of use in repeated anaesthesia to make a definite recommendation in this regard.
Isoflurane has been reported to interact with dry carbon dioxide adsorbents during closed circuit anaesthesia, to form carbon monoxide. Inhalation of carbon monoxide may lead to formation of significant levels of carboxyhaemoglobin in exposed patients. Carboxyhaemoglobin is toxic even in low concentrations and is not easily detected by standard anaesthesia monitors such as pulse oximeters. Direct measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin should be carried out in the event that a patient on closed circuit anaesthesia with an implicated agent develops oxygen desaturation which does not respond to the usual therapeutic measures. All necessary precautions should be taken to ensure that carbon dioxide adsorbents are not allowed to dry out.
Caution should be exercised when administering isoflurane to patients with pre-existing liver disease. Isoflurane is a powerful systemic and coronary arterial dilator. The effect on systemic arterial pressure is easily controlled in the normal healthy patient and has been used specifically as a means of inducing hypotension. However, the phenomenon of 'coronary steal' means that isoflurane should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease. In particular, patients with subendocardial ischaemia might be anticipated to be more susceptible.Salivation and tracheo-bronchial secretions may
be stimulated in children but pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are quickly diminished.As because, levels of anaesthesia can be altered easily and quickly with isoflurane, only vaporisers which produce a predictable concentration with a good degree of accuracy should be used. The degree of hypotension and ventilatory depression may provide some indication as to the level of anaesthesia. The level of anaesthesia may be changed quickly with isoflurane. Heart rhythm remains stable but spontaneous breathing thould be monitored closely and supported where necessary.It is recommended that vapour from this and other inhalational agents are efficiently extracted from the area of use.
Isoflurane should only be administered by, or in the presence of, anaesthetists with the appropriate anaesthesia and resuscitation equipment.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> There are insufficient data are available on human studies to estimate the risk of teratogenicity in children of women who receive isoflurane anaesthesia during pregnancy. However, isoflurane is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy.
All anaesthetics should be avoided during pregnancy if possible. Unavoidable anaesthesia with isoflurane should be undertaken with due caution. A suitable level of anaesthesia foraesarean section can be maintained with 0.5- 0.75% isoflurane in oxygen/nitrous oxide. Increased blood loss has been observed, comparable with other volatile anaesthetics (e.g halothane), in patients undergoing uterine curettage or other gynaecological surgical procedures.
n nursing mother, if isoflurane is necessary to be administered, lactation is to be interruped after the anaesthesia. Lactation can be restarted after the drug has been discharged from the circulation.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Isoflurane has a slight pungent ethereal odour, which may limit the rate of gas induction but, despite this , induction and particularly recovery are rapid. The use of isoflurane-specific vaporisers will facilitate accurate control of the administered concentration of anaesthetic. The MAC (Minimum Alveolar Concentration), the standard measure of potency for anaesthetics, is 1.15% in pure oxygen, decreasing to 0.5% when given with 75% nitrous oxide, for middle-aged humans. There is an age- relationship: the MAC is significantly higher in children and lower in the elderly.   Premedication: Premedication drugs should be selected according to the needs of the patient. The ventilatory depressant effect of isoflurane should be taken into account. Anticholinergic drugs (e.g atropine, glycopyrrolate USP) may be used for their effects in drying oral secretions (antisialogogue) at the discretion of the anaesthetist, but they may enhance the weak effects of isoflurane in increasing heart rate.<br><br>

<STRONG>Induction:</STRONG> As isoflurane has a mild pungency, inhalation should usually be preceded by the use of a short acting barbiturate, or other intravenous induction agent, to prevent coughing. Salivation and coughing may be troublesome in small children induced with isoflurane. Alternatively, isoflurane with oxygen or with an oxygen/nitrous oxide mixture may be administered. It is recommended that induction with isoflurane be initiated at a concentration of 0.5%. Concentrations of 1.5-3.0% usually produce surgical anaesthesia in 7-10 minutes. Blood pressure decreases during induction but this may be compensated by surgical stimulation. Maintenance: Adequate anaesthesia for surgery may be sustained with an inspired isoflurane concentration of 1.0-2.5% in an oxygen/70% nitrous oxide mixture. Additional inspired isoflurane (0.5-1.0%) will be required with lower nitrous oxide levels, or when isoflurane is given with oxygen alone or with air/oxygen mixtures. Blood pressure decreases during maintenance anaesthesia in relation to the depth of anaesthesia. That is, blood pressure is inversely related to the isoflurane concentration. Provided there are no other complicating factors, this is probably due to peripheral vasodilation. Cardiac rythm remains stable. Excessive falls in blood pressure may be due to the depth of anaesthesia and in such circumstances this can be corrected by reducing the inspired isoflurane concentration.Induced hypotesion can be achieved by artificially ventilating patients with isoflurane 2.5-4.0%. Pre-treatment with Clonidine significantly decreases the isoflurane requirement for maintaining induced hypotension.<br><br>

<STRONG>Recovery:</STRONG> The concentration of isoflurane can be reduced to 0.5% at the start of closing the operation wound, and then to 0% at the start of closing the operation wound, and then to 0% at the end of surgery, provided that the anaesthetist is satisfied that the effect of any neuromuscular blocking durgs has been reversed and the patients is no longer paralysed. After discontinuation of all anaesthetics, the airways of the patient should be ventilated several times with oxygen 100% until complete recovery.<br><br>

        <p> Antimuscarinic drugs are used in anaesthesia as premedication to dry bronchial and salivary secretions. These are also used before or with neostigmine halothane, propofol, and suxamethonium to prevent bradycardia, hypotension and excessive salivation. But, now a day this are being rarely used for premedication. However, still these drugs playing emergency role in the treatment of vagotonic side-effects, and in acute arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. These drugs include: Atropine, Hyoscine, Glycopyrronium, Phenothiazines.

          <h3> KETOROLAC TROMETHAMINE: Tablet/ Injection  </h3>
          <p>  <strong>Ind:</strong> Relief of pain associated with surgical procedures such as major abdo-minal, orthopaedic, dental, or gynaeco-logical surgery; acute & chronic musculo-skeletal pain, renal colic, cancer pain.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Active peptic ulceration, history of peptic ulcer; coagulation disorders; hypersensitivity to ketorolac trometamol; aspirin/NSAID-induced allergy; concomitant treatment with lithium salts. Avoid in pregnant and breast-feeding women. <br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Gastrointestinal- nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, peptic ulcer, haemorrhage, perforation, liver function abnormalities. CNS/musculoskeletal- drowsiness, dizziness, sweating, convulsions.
Renal- acute renal failure, flank pain, haematuria. Other- hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema, hypotension, flushing, rash), oedema, purpura, myalgia, post- operative wound haemorrhage, injection site pain. <br><br>

<strong>Precautions & Warnings:</strong> Use with care in the elderly, in patients with a history of gastro- intestinal disease, those with asthma, cardiac, renal, hepatic, or allergic disease, and those who are hypovolaemic. Ketorolac should not normally be used in severe renal impairment. NSAIDs have been associated with renal disease. Ketorolac inhibits platelet aggregation and prolongs bleeding time. Caution is advised where strict haemostasis is critical. Monitor prothrombin time of patients on oral anticoagulants. Salicylates reduce plasma protein binding of ketorolac. Renal clearance of ketorolac is decreased by probenecid. NSAIDs decrease renal clearance of methotrexate.Ketorolac reduces the diuretic response to frusemide. Concomitant use of other NSAIDs is not recommended.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> By mouth: Adult- 10mg every 4-6 hourly (elderly 6-8 hourly); max 40mg daily; maximum duration of treatment 7 days; Child- under 16 years, not recommended.By i.m or i.v injection: Adult- short-term management of post-operative pain, initially 10mg i.m or i.v followed by 10-30mg 4-6 hourly (2 hourly in initial post-operative period); max. 90mg daily (elderly & patients weighing less than 50kg max. 60mg daily); maximum duration of treatment 2 days.Short-term management of pain on a regular schedule- 30-60mg i.m as a loading dose, followed by 15-30mg 6 hourly; max. 150mg for 1st day & 120mg/day thereafter.Pain associated with surgical procedures- 30mg i.m followed by 10-30mg 4-6 hourly. Parenteral use of ketorolac is not recommended for longer period (not more than 5 days).<br><br>

	in general anaesthesia & severe pain </a>
      <div data-role="collapsible-set" data-theme="b">
        <div data-role="collapsible"> <!-- collapsible -->
          <h3> FENTANYL CITRATE: Injection  </h3>
          <p> Fentanyl citrate 78.5mcg equivalent to 50mcg per ml fentanyl base: injection<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic used:
in low doses to provide analgesia during short surgical procedures.
in high doses as an analgesic/respiratory depressant in patients requiring assisted ventilation.in combination with a neuroleptic in the technique of neuroleptanalgesia.in the treatment of severe pain, such as the pain of myocardial infarction.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Respiratory depression, obstructive airways disease. Concurrent administration with monoamine inhibitors, or within 2 weeks of their discontinuation. Known intolerance to fentanyl or other morphinomimetics.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong>The side effects are those associated with intravenous opioids e.g respiratory depression, apnoea, muscular rigidity (which may also involve the thoracic muscles), myoclonic movements, bradycardia, transient hypotension, nausea, vomiting and dizziness.Other less frequently reported adverse effects are- laryngospasm, allergic reactions (e.g anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, pruritus, urticaria) and asystole although it is uncertain whether there is a causal relationship as several drugs were co- administered; secondary rebound respiratory depression has rarely been reported.
When a neuroleptic such as droperidol is used with fentanyl, the following adverse ereactions may be observed- chills and/or shivering, restlessness, post operative hallucinatory episodes and extrapyramidal symptoms.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Tolerance and dependence may occur. Following i.v administration of fentanyl, a transient fall in blood pressure may occur, specially in hypovolaemic patients. Appropriate measures to maitain a stable arterial pressure should be taken.Significant respiratory depression will occur following the administration of fentanyl in doses in excess of 200mcg. This, & the other pharmaco- logical effects of fentanyl, can be reversed by specific narcotic antagonists (e.g naloxone). Additional doses of the latter may be necessary because the respiratory depression may last longer than the duration of action of the opioid antagonist. Bradycardia and possibly asystole can occur innon-atropinised patients, and can be antagoninsed by atropine.Muscular rigidity (morphine-like effect) may occur. Rigidity, which may also involve the thoracic muscles, can be avoided by the following measures:<br>
- slow i.v injection (usually sufficient for lower doses).<br>
- premedication with benzodiazepines.<br>
- use of muscle relaxants.<br><br>

As with all opioid analgesics, care should betaken when administering fentanyl to patients with myasthenia gravis. It is wise to reduce dosage in the elderly and debilitated patients.In hypothyroidism, pulmonary disease, decreased respiratory reserve, alcoholism and liver or renal impairment- the dosage should be titrated with care and prolonged monitoring may be required. Patients on chronic opioid therapy or with a history of opioid abuse may require higher doses. Administration in labour may cause respiratory depression in the new born infant.As with all potent opioids, profound analgesia is accompanied by marked respiratory depression, which may persist into or recur in the early postoperative period. Care should be taken after large doses or infusions of fentanyl to ensure that adequate spontaneous breathing has been established and maintained before discharging the patient from the recovery area.Resuscitation equipment and opioid antagonists should be readily available. Hyperventilation during anaesthesia may alter the patients response to CO2, thus affecting respiration postoperatively. The use of rapid bolus injections of opioids should be avoided in patients with compromised intracerebral compliance; in such patients the transient decrease in the mean arterial pressure has occasionally been accompanied by a transient reduction of the cerebral perfusion pressure. <br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> As there is not sufficient data are available to evaluate any harmful effects in human, before using the drug in pregnancy, possible risks should be weighed against potential benefits to the patient. Administration during childbirth (including caesarean section) is not recommended because fentanyl crosses the placenta and the foetal respiratory centre is particularly sensitive to opioids. Nevertheless, if fentanyl is administered, an antidote for the child should always be at hand. As fentanyl may be excreted in the maternal milk, it is therefore recommeded not to initiate breast feeding within 24 hours of treatment. <br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Fentanyl injection can be administered intravenously either as a bolus or by infusion & by intramuscular route also. The dose of fentanyl should be individualised according to age, body weight, physical status, underlying pathological condition, use of other drugs and type of surgery and anaesthesia. The usual dosage regimen is as follows:
fentanyl may be given intrmauscularly 45 minutes before induction of anaesthesia. After i.v administration in unpremedi-cated
adult patients, 2ml fentanyl may be expected to provide sufficient analgesia for 10-20 minutes in surgical procedures involving low pain intensity. 10ml fentanyl injected as a bolus gives analgesia lasting about one hour. The analgesia produced is sufficient for surgery involving moderately painful procedures. Giving a dose of 50mcg/kg fentanyl will provide intense analgesia for some four to six hours, for intensely stimulating surgery. Fentanyl may also be given as an infusion. In ventilated patients, a loading dose of fentanyl may be given as a fast infusion ofapproximately 1mcg/kg/min for the first 10 minutes followed by an infusion of approximately 0.1mcg/kg/min. Alternatively the loading dose of fentanyl may be given as a bolus. Infusion rates should be titrated to individual patient response; lower infusion rates may be adequate. Unless it is planned to ventilate post- operatively, the infusion should be terminated at about 40 minutes before the end of surgery. Lower infusion rates, e.g 0.05-0.08mcg/ kg/min. are necessary if spontaneous ventilation is to be maintained. Higher infusion rates (up to 3mcg/kg/min) have been used in cardiac surgery. Fentanyl is chemically incopatible with the induction agents thiopentone and methohexitone because of wide differences in pH. Use in elderly and debilitated patients: It is wise to reduce the dosage in the elderly and debilitated patients. The effect of the initial dose should be taken into account in determining supplemental doses. Overdose: Please consult manufacturer's literature. Interactions: The use of opioid premedication, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, halogenic gases and other non-selective CNS depressants (e.g alcohol) may enhance or prolong the respiratory depression of fentanyl. When patients have received CNS- depressants, the dose of fentanyl required will be less than usual. Likewise, following the administration of fentanyl the dose of other CNS-depressant drugs should be reduced.   </p>

            <h3>DUROGESIC Transdermal Patch Janssen-</h3>
            <p> Durogesic is a transdermal system providing continuous systemic delivery of fentanyl for 72 hrs. Durogesic patch is a rectangular transparent unit comprising a protective liner and four functional layers. From the outer surface to the surface adhering to skin, these layers are: i. a backing layer of polyester film; ii. a drug reservoir of fentanyl (2.5mg/10 cm2) and alcohol USP (0.1ml/10 cm2) gelled with hydroxyethyl cellulose; iii. an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer membrane that controls the rate of fentanyl delivery; and iv. a layer of silicone adhesive. Before use, the protective liner is removed & discarded.Durogesic is available in four different strengths, the composition of which per unit area is identical. The 10-, 20-, 30- and 40 cm2 systems are designed to deliver fentanyl 25, 50, 75 and 100mg/hour respectively to the systemic circulation, which represent about 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 & 2.4mg per day. The other components are pharma- cologically inactive. Less than 0.2ml of alcohol is released from the system during a 72-hour use. <br><br>

            <strong>Ind:</strong> Management of chronic cancer pain and intractable pain requiring opioid analgesia.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Please see above under the text of fentanyl. <br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> The most serious adverse reaction, as with all potent opioids, is hypoventilation. Other opioid-related adverse reactions include- nausea, vomiting, constipation; hypotension; somnolence, confusion, hallucinations, euphoria; pruritus and urinary retention.Skin reactions such as rash, erythema & itching have occasionally been reported. These reactions usually resolve within 24 hr. of removal of the patch. <br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Please see above under the text of fentanyl.<br><br>


<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Durogesic doses should be individualized based upon the status of the patient and should be assessed at regular intervals after application.It should be applied to non-irritated and non- irradiated skin on a flat surface of the torso or upper arms. Hair at the application site (a non- hairy area is preferable) should be clipped (not shaved) prior to application. If the site of Durogesic application requires to be cleansed prior to application of the patch, this should be done with clear water. Soaps, oils, lotions, or any other agent that might irritate the skin or alter its characteristics should not be used. The skin should be completely dry before the patch is applied.Durogesic should be applied immediately upon removal from the sealed package. The transdermal patch should be pressed firmly in place with the palm of the hand for approximately 30 seconds, making sure the contact is complete, specially around the edges. Durogesic may be worn continuously for 72 hours. A new patch should be applied to a different skin site after removal of the previous transdermal patch. Several days should elapse before a new patch is applied to the smae area of the skin.
1. Initial dose selection: The size of the initial
durogesic dose should be based on the patient's opioid history, including the degree of opioid tolerance, if any, as well as on the current general condition and medical status of the patient.<br><br>


In opioid-naive patients, the lowest durogesic dose, 25mg/h, should be used as the initial dose.Calculate the previous 24-hour analgesic requirement.
Convert this amount to the equianalgesic morphine dose using conversion table
(please see manufacturer's literature). Both in opioid-naive and opioid-tolerant patients, the initial evaluation of the maximum analgesic effect of durogesic, cannot be made before the system is worn for 24 hours. This delay is due to the gradual increase in serum fentanyl concentration in the 24 hours following initial system application.Previous analgesic therapy should therefore be gradually phased out after the initial dose application until analgesic efficacy with durogesic is attained.
<br><br>

2. Dose titration and maintenance therapy: The durogesic patch should be replaced every 72 hours. The dose should be titrated individually until analgesic efficacy is attained. If analgesia is insufficient after the initial application the dose may be increased after 3 days. Thereafter, dose adjustment can take place every 3 days. Dosage titration should normally be performed in 25mg/h increments, although the supplementary analgesic requirements (oral morphine 90mg/day= durogesic 25mg/h) and pain status of the patient should be taken into account. More than one durogesic patch may be used for doses greater than 100mg/h. Patients may require periodic supplemental doses of a short-acting analgesic for 'breakthrough' pain. Some patients may require additional or alternative methods of opioid administration when the durogesic dose exceeds 300mg/hour.<br><br>

3. Discontinuation of durogesic: If discontinuation of durogesic is necessary, replacement with other opioids should be gradual, starting at a low dose and increasing slowly. This is because fentanyl levels fall gradually after durogesic is removed; it takes 17 hours or more for the fentanyl serum concen- tration to decrease 50%. In general, the disconti- nuation of opioid analgesia should be gradual. Overdose: Please consult manufacturer's literature. <strong>Drug inter:</strong> See above under the text of fentanyl. <br>Tiansdermal patch 25mcg/h (Fentanyl 2.5mg) x 5's pack: 1933.55 MRP<br>

          <h3> CARDIOPLEGIA Soln. DBL/Globex  </h3>
          <p> Cardioplegia solution is a sterile, clear, colourless solution containing magnesium chloride 162.7mg, potassium chloride 59.6mg and procaine hydrochloride 13.64mg in each ml: solution for infusion.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> To induce ischaemic cardiac arrest in cardiopulmonary bypass and open-heart surgery. It is usually combined with hypothermia to further assist the cardiac arrest.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> None known<br><br>

<strong>A/R:</strong> Any adverse reactions are often related to the potential hazards associated with open-heart surgery: Myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic abnormalities and arrhythmias. Delayed or absent recovery after circulation is restored following chemically- induced cardiac arrest.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Do not use solution unless it is clear and free from particulate matter. Cardioplegia solution must be diluted before use. The solution is not for intravenous injection but only of instillation into coronary arteries during cardiopulmonary bypass when the coronary circulation is isolated from the systemic circulation. Cardioplegia solution should be cooled to 8°C prior to administration.
Monitoring of myocardial activity & temperature should continue throughout the procedure. Appropriate equipment should be available to defibrillate the heart following instillation with Cardioplegia solution.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> It is not known if cardioplegia solution adversely affects the foetus or infant when given to pregnant or breast feeding mothers. The benefits must be weighed against the potential adverse effects.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> 20ml Cardioplegia solution is added to I litre Ringer's solution. The solution is cooled (2-8°C) prior to use. The solution is then administered by rapid infusion into the aortic root at a rate of about 300ml/m2/min for 3 minutes initially. Reinfusion is usually done every 30minutes or sooner if the myocardial
temperature reaches 18°C or returning cardiac activity is observed.
Discard any unused portion.
Overdosage: Excessive administration may
manifest unnecessary dilatation of coronary
vessels and leakage into the perivascular myocardium, which may lead to oedema.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> No information is available. But, cardioplegia solution is potentially incompatible with aminophylline, barbiturates, magenesium sulphate, phenytoin sodium, sodium bicarbonte, amikacin sulphate, dobutamine hydrochloride and amphotericin.

	      <h3> Prescribing Notes  </h3>
	      <p> Action & properties: Non-depolarising muscle relaxants (also known as competitive muscle relaxants) cause blockade by competing with acetylcholine at the receptor sites at the neuromu- scular junction and their action may be reversed with anticholinesterases (such as neostigmine). Non-depolarising muscle relaxants have a slower onset of action than depolarising muscle relaxants (e.g suxamethonium).
		These drugs can be classified by their duration of action as- short-acting (15-30minutes), intermediate-acting (30-40 minutes), and long- acting (60-120 minutes), although duration of action is dose-dependent.
		Non-depolarising muscle relaxants have no
		sedative or analgesic effects.
		Classification: Non-depolarising muscle relaxants may be divided into:
		(a) Aminosteroid group: which includes- pancuronium, pipecuromium, rocuronium and vecuronium.
		(b) Benzylisoquinolinium group: which includes- atracurium, cisatracurium, gallamine and mivacurium.<br><br>

		<strong>S/E:</strong> See under individual preparations.<br><br>

     <strong>Cautions:</strong> Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents has been reported; caution is advised in cases of hypersensitivity to these drugs. Their activity is prolonged in patients with myasthenia gravis and in hypothermia, therefore lower doses are required. Resistance may develop in patients with burns who may require increased doses.
		Dosage: See under individual preparations.   </p>

          <h3> ATRACURIUM BESYLATE: Injection  </h3>
          <p>  Atracurium is a mixture of 10 isomers and is a benzylisoquinolinium muscle relaxant with an intermediate duration of action.<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> See above under the text of non- depolarising muscle relaxant.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Non-depolarising (competitive) muscle relaxant of medium duration (15-40 mins.) for use in surgical & anaesthetic procedures.
Advantage- it has an advantage over other non- depolarising muscle relaxants in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, as it is degraded by non-enzymatic Hofmann elimination. It is non- cumulative on repeated dosage. Its action is reversed by Neostigmine.
Disadvantage- its cardiovascular effects are associated with significant histamine release. <br><br>

S/E; & <strong>Cautions:</strong> As benzylisoquinolinium non- depolarising muscle relaxants (except cisatracurium) are associated with histamine release which can cause skin flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, bronchospasm and rarely, anaphylactoid reactions. Special precaution on concurrent admin. of aminoglycosides or polypeptide antibiotics.<br><br>

<strong>Adult:</strong> 03-0.6mg/kg i.v. Full block can be prolonged with supplementary doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg as required. Endotracheal intubation can usually be accomplished within 90 seconds of i.v injection of 0.5-0.6mg/kg.<br><br>

<strong>Child:</strong> Under 1 year, not recommended; over 1 year, same as adult in proportion to body-wt. Continuous Infusion: Suitable for admin. by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.005- 0.01mg/kg/min. (03-0.6 mg/kg/hour) to maintain neuromuscular block during long surgical procedures.  </p>

          <h3> PIPECURONIUM BROMIDE: Injection  </h3>
          <p>  Pipecuronium bromide belongs to non- depolarising (competitive) neuromuscular blocking agents; available as 4mg/2ml ampoule. Mode of action: See above under the text of non- depolarising muscle relaxant.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> It is indicated as an adjunct to general anaesthesia, to facilitate tracheal intubation and to
provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. It produces effective skeletal muscle relaxation for approximately 40- 60 min. Reduced supplemental doses maintain muscle relaxation as long as necessary.<br><br>

C/I; S/E; <strong>Cautions:</strong> See under pancuronium bromide; reduce dose in renal impairment; should not be given with depolarising muscle relaxants (as they may cause intensification or reduction of action, depending on dose, time of application and individual response).<br><br>

<strong>Warnings:</strong> It should be administered under the supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with the possible complications that might occur following its use.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & Application:</strong> Adults & elderly: The usual initial dose for intubation and subsequent surgery is 0.07-0.08mg/kg body-weight intravenously. This dose produces relaxation suitable for intubation within 90-120 sec lasting for 50-70min. In patients intubated by succinylcholine the usual initial dose after intubation is 0.04-0.05mg/kg body-weight. Duration of action is of 15-25 min depending on individual response. Higher doses produce prolonged action. To patients with renal failure not higher doses than 0.04mg/kg body-weight are suggested (prolongation of effect may occur). Repeated dose is usually 25% of the initial dose, i.e 0.010-0.015mg/kg body-weight.<br><br>

 <strong>Children & neonates:</strong> In case of diazepam- ketamine-fentanyl-nitrous oxide is applied in children, larger than the adult doses, i.e 80-90 mcg/kg are suggested. In neonates, lower than the children doses, i.e. 50-60 mcg/kg are suggested. These doses produce relaxation for surgical interventions of 25-35 min duration. If necessary, muscle relaxation can be prolonged for further 25-35 min by the supplemental administration of the one third of the initial dose. Residual relaxation can be reversed rapidly and safely by the administration of neostigmine and atropine. Due to the great variety of individual response, monitoring of drug effect by a peripheral nerve stimulator is highly recommended.  </p>

          <h3> SUXAMETHONIUM: Injection  </h3>
          <p> Suxamethonium chloride 50mg/ml; 2ml ampoule: injection<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Depolarising muscle relaxant of short duration. It produces rapid, complete, and predictable paralysis, and recovery is spontaneous. Unlike the non-depolarising muscle relaxants its action cannot be reversed and clinical application is therefore limited.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Severe liver disease and in burned patients.<br><br>

 S/E; <strong>Cautions:</strong> It should be given after induction of anaesthesia because paralysis is usually preceded by painful muscle fasciculation. Premedication with atropine is desirable. There is a transient rise in plasma potassium and creative phosphokinase and there may be muscle pains postoperatively.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> By i.v injection: Adult, 600mcg/kg (range 0.3-1.1 mg/kg depending on degree of relaxation required); usual range 20-
100mg; Infant, under 1 year, 2mg/kg.
Child, 1-12 years, 1-2mg/kg.By i.v infusion: As a 0.1% solution, 2-5mg/min. (or 2-5ml/minute).   </p>

          <h3> TOLPERISONE: Tablet/Injection </h3>
          <p>  Tolperisone is a centrally acting muscle relaxant. It is available as parenteral injection, tolperisone hydrochloride 100mg with lidocaine hydrochloride 2.5mg/1ml ampoule & 50mg as oral tablet.
          <br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> It is a centrally acting muscle relaxant. The drug reduces experimental hypertonia & decerebration rigidity. It inhibits reticulospinal reflex facilitaion without affecting cortical functions. It improves peripheral blood flow. The circulatory effect is supposed to be based on peripheral mechanism and is indepen- dent from the cerebral centres of vasoregulation. <br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Increased tone of skeletal muscles due to organic neurologic disorders (e.g injury of the pyramidal tract, multiple sclerosis, myelopathy, encephalomyelitis etc), muscular hypertension, muscular spasm, muscular contracture, rigidity, spinal automatism and discopathy. Obliterative vascular diseases (obliterative arteriosclerosis, diabetic angiopathy, obliterative thromboangitis, Raynaud's disease, diffuse scleroderma), and disorders due to injured innervation of the vessels (acrocyanosis, intermittent angioneurotic dysbasia). In individual cases post-thrombotic venous & lymphatic circulation disorders, crural ulcer.
<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Myasthenia gravis. The drug cannot be given in pregnancy, to nursing mothers and to children. <br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Muscular weakness, somnolence. At rare occasions hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic shock, dyspnoea); skin symptoms (pruritus, erythema, maculopapulous eruptions); hypotension; nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort may occur.Adverse reactions can be eliminated by reducing the dose.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> By injection: Daily 200mg given intramuscularly or daily 100mg with slow intravenous administration.<br><br>

By mouth: Adult: 150-450mg 3 times daily according to the individual requirements and tolerance of the patient. Children, from 3 mon to 6 yrs- 5-10mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses (1-3 tabs. daily). 6-14 yrs. 4-2mg/kg/day, divided into 3 doses.  </p>

          <p> NEOSTIGMINE: Injection<br><br>
Neostigmine is an anticholinesterase, used in general anaesthesia to reverse the action of non- depolarising neuromuscular agent.
<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Reversal of non-depolarising neuromuscular blockade, premedication for surgical & anaesthetic procedures; treatment & diagnosis of Myasthenia gravis.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Intestinal or urinary obstruction.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Nausea, vomiting, increased salivation, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps; signs of overdoses are increased g.i. discomfort, bronchial secretions & sweating, involuntary defaecation & micturition, miosis, nystagmus, bradycardia, hypotension, agitation, excessive dreaming & weakness eventually leading to fasciculation & paralysis. <br><br>

<strong>Cautions:</strong> Asthma, bradycardia, recent myocardial infarction, epilepsy, hypotension, parkinsonism, vagotonia, pregnancy, peptic ulcer; atropine or other antidote to muscarinic effect may be necessary (particularly when neostigmine given by i.m. inj.) but it should not be given
routinely as it may mask the signs of over dosage.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Adult: 1-5mg i.v. with 0.4- 1.25mg atropine given some minutes before. Child: 0.125mg-1mg i.v. with atropine 0.02- 0.03 mg/kg.   </p>

          <h3> ANEXATE Inj. Roche  </h3>
          <p>  Flumazenil 0.5mg/5ml ampoule: i.v injection <br><br>

          <strong>Ind:</strong> Flumazenil is indicated for reversal of the centrally acting sedative effects of benzodiazepines. It is therefore used in anesthesia and intensive care in the following indications:
In anesthesia: 1. Termination of general anesthesia induced & maintained with benzodiaze- pines in inpatients. 2. Reversal of benzodiazepine sedation in short diagnostic & therapeutic procedures in both inpatients & outpatients.
In intensive care: 1. Flumazenil provides diagnostic indications of intoxication with benzodiazepines or rules such intoxication out. 2. As a diagnostic measure in unconsciousness of unknown origin to differentiate between involvement of benzodiazepines, other drugs or brain damage. 3. As specific reversal of the central effects of benzodiazepines in drug overdose (return to spontaneous respiration & consciousness in order to render intubation unnecessary or allow extubation).<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
In mixed intoxications with benzodiazepines & tricyclic antidepressants, the toxicity of the antidepressants can be masked by protective benzodiazepine effects. In the presence of autonomic (anticholinergic), neurological (motor abnormalities) or cardiovascular symptoms of severe intoxication with tricyclics/tetracyclics, flumazenil should not be used to reverse benzodiazepine effects.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Flumazenil was well tolerated even at high parenteral doses of up to 100mg. In rare cases during use in anesthesia, flush, nausea and/or vomiting have been reported. Complaints such as feelintg of anxiety, palpitations & fear have been infrequently observed after rapid injection of flumazenil. These undesirable effects usually did not necessitate special treatment.
Very rarely, seizures have been reported, particularly in patients known to suffer from epilepsy.
Rapid injection of flumazenil in patients with
long-term exposure to benzodiazepines ending at any time within the weeks preceding flumazenil administration may produce withdrawal symptoms & should therefore be avoided. If such symptoms arise, a slow i.v injection of 5mg diazepam or 5mg midazolam should be given.<br><br>

<strong>Cautions:</strong> The use of flumazenil is not recommended in epileptic patients who have been receiving benzodiazepine treatment for a prolonged period. Although flumazenil exerts a slight intrinsic anticonvulsant effect, its abrupt suppression of the protective effect of a benzodiazepine agonist can give rise to convulsions in epileptic patients.
Pateints with severe head injury (and/or unstable intracranial pressure) treated with flumazenil to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines may develop raised intracranial pressure.
Avoid such works & activities requiring complete mental alertness, e.g operating machineries, driving etc.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> Although there are no controlled studies involving pregnant women, a general medical principle has been adopted, that no drugs should be administered in the early stages of pregnancy except where absolutely necessary.
Parenteral administration of flumazenil in emergencies is not contraindicated during lactation.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Flumazenil should be administered i.v by an anesthesiologist or experienced physician.
For infusion, flumazenil may be diluted with dextrose 5% or sodium chloride 0.9%; it may also be used concurrently with other resuscitative procedures.
In anesthesia: The recommended initial dose is 0.2mg administered i.v within 15 seconds. If the desired degree of consciousness is not obtained within 60 seconds, a second dose (0.1mg) can be injected, and this may be repeated at 60- second intervals where necessary, up to a total dose of lmg. The usual dose is 0.3-0.6mg.
Note: When used in anesthesiology at the end of an operation, flumazenil should not be injected until the effect of peripheral muscle relaxants has subsided.
In the intensive care unit: The recommended initial dose is 0.3mg i.v. If the desired degree of consciousness is not obtained within 60 seconds, flumazenil may be injected repeatedly until the patient awakes or up to a total dose of 2mg. If drowsiness recurs, an i.v infusion of 0.1-0.4mg/hour has been shown to be useful. The rate of infusion should be individually adjusted up to the desired level of arousal.
In the intensive care unit, patients treated for a long time with high doses of benzodiazepines, the individually titrated injections of flumazenil, slowly administered, should not produce withdrawal syndromes. If unexpected signs of overstimulation occur, 5mg diazepma or 5mg midazolam should be given intravenously. If a significant improvement in consciousness or respiratory function is not obtained after repeated doses of flumazenil, a nonbenzodiazepine etiology must be assumed. Overdosage: When given at a dosage of 100mg i.v, no symptoms of overdosage were observed.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Flumazenil blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines by competitive interaction at the receptor level.
The effects of nonbenzodiazepine agonists at benzodiazepine receptors, such as zopiclone, triazolopyridazines & others, are also blocked by flumazenil.
Particular caution is necessary when using flumazenil in cases of mixed drug overdose since the toxic effects (such as convulsions & cardiac dysrhythmias) of other drugs taken in overdose (specially cyclic antidepressants) may emerge with the reversal of the benzodiazepine effects by flumazenil.
The pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepine agonists are unaltered in the presence of flumazenil & vice versa.<br><br>

          <h3> BUPIVACAINE HCL: Heavy Injection  </h3>
          <p> Bupivacaine heavy injection is a solution containing bupivacaine hydrochloride and dextrose. Each ml contains bupivacaine hydrochloride (as anhydrous) USP 5mg & dextrose (as monohydrate) USP 80mg. Bupivacaine heavy has rapid onset of action and long duration. The duration of analgesia in the T10-T12 segments is 2-3 hours.<br><br>
		<strong>Ind:</strong> Spinal anaesthesia for-
		Urological surgery (lasting 2-3 hours)
		Lower limb surgery (lasting 2-3 hours) Abdominal surgery (lasting 45-60 minutes)<br><br>

		C/I; S/E; <strong>Cautions:</strong> See above under Bupivacaine hydrochloride injection.<br><br>

		<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> The doses recommended below should be regarded as a guide for use in the average adult.
		Spinal anaesthesia for surgery: 2-4ml (10-20mg). The spread of anaesthesia obtained with Bupivacaine heavy depends on several factors
		including the volume of solution and the position of the patient during and following the injection. When injected in the L3-L4 intervertebral space with the patient in the sitting position, 3ml of Bupivacaine heavy spreads to the T7-T10 spinal segments. With the patient receiving the injection in the horizontal position and then turned supine, the blockade spreads to T4-T7 spinal segments. It should be understood that the level of spinal anaesthesia achieved with any local anaesthetic can be unpredictable in a given patient.The effects of bupivacaine heavy exceeding 5ml have not yet been studied and such volumes can therefore not be recommended.   </p>

          <p> Ephedrine hydrochloride 5mg/ml; 5ml (25mg) ampoule: injection.<br><br>
<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic agent with direct and indirect effects on adrenergic receptors. It acts indirectly by releasing neurotransmitter from storage sites in the sympathetic nerves to the effector organ. It has both a- and b- adrenergic activity.
The most common adverse effects associated with spinal or epidural anaesthesia involve the cardiovascular system. Sympathetic block results in venodilatation, reduced venous return, decreased cardiac output and hypotension. Patients with hypovolaemia due to any cause can develop sudden and severe hypotension during spinal anaesthesia. Ephedrine hydrochloride
injection is used as vasoconstrictor sympathomimetic for the reversal of hypotension from spinal or epidural anaesthesia. It has also been recommended for prophylactic use before spinal or epidural block in patients at high risk of hypotension.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> It is indicated to reverse hypotension induced by spinal or epidural anaesthesia & to prevent hypotension from spinal anaesthesia.
<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Breast-feeding.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Nausea, vomiting, anorexia; tachycardia (sometimes bradycardia), arrhythmias, anginal pain, vasoconstriction with hypertension, vasodilation with hypotension, dizziness and flushing; dyspnoea; headache, anxiety, restlessness, confusion, psychoses, insomnia, tremor; difficulty in micturition, urine retention; sweating, hypersalivation, changes in blood glucose concentration.<br><br>

Pre<strong>Cautions:</strong> It should be given with care in patients with hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, or renal impairment or angle-closure glaucoma. It may cause acute urine retention in prostatic hypertrophy.

 <br><br><strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> Injection of ephedrine during labour can cause fetal tachycardia. It is contraindicated for breast-feeding women. <br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> IV administration: To reverse hypotension induced by spinal or epidural anaesthesia, preferably 3-6mg (max. 9mg) repeated every 3-4 minutes to max. 30mg by slow intravenous injection or as advised by the concerned physician.IM administration: To prevent hypotension from spinal anaesthesia, 15-30mg may be given by intramuscular injection before induction of anaesthesia.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: The administration of ephedrine to patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can result in severe hypertension.
Acetazolamide: Acetazolamide induced alkalization of urine reduces the urinary clearance of ephedrine. Dexamethasone: Ephedrine has been shown to increase the clearance and prolong the half life of dexamethasone in asthmatic patients. Theophylline: Ephedrine shows synergistic toxicity with theophylline; combination causes insomnia, nervousness, gastrointestinal complaints including vomiting.
Antihypertensive agents: Loss of blood pressure control has been detected in patients given ephedrine & adrenergic neuron blocking drugs concurrently. 5ml amp x 10's pack: 120.00 MRP   </p>
