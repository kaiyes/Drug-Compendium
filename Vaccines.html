          <h3>VARILRIX Inj. GlaxoSmithKlin   </h3>
          <p> Varilrix is a lyophilised preparation of the live attenuated Oka strain of varicella-zoster virus, obtained by propagation of the virus in MRC human diploid cell culture.
          Each dose of the reconsituted vaccine contains not less than 10 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the attenuated varicella-zoster virus.<br><br>

          <strong>Ind:</strong> Active immunisation against varicella of healthy subjects from the age of 12 months onwards; active immunisation against varicella of susceptible high-risk patients and their susceptible healthy close-contacts.
          <br><br>

          <strong>S/E:</strong> In healthy subjects, side-effects are very low and rare in all age groups.
          In age group 9 mon. to 12 years: papulov-esicular eruptions (4%); mild fever (5%).In age group 13 years & above with a 2-dose schedule-no papulo-vesicular eruptions have been reported.General symptoms, such as headache, fever, paresthesia & fatigue are reported in 2.5% cases after each dose.In high-risk patients, papulo-vesicular eruptions, rarely accompanied by mild to moderate fever as in leukaemic patients (less than a quarter of patients). The appearanec of these eruptions do not influence the clinical mamagement of the patients.<br><br>

          <strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> After reconstitution, Varilrix TM should be administered immediately. Alcohol and other disinfecting agents must be allowed to evaporate from the skin before injection of the vaccine since they may inactivate the viruses. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine. For this reason, the vaccinee should remain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after immunisation.Varilrix should not be administered intradermally & under no circumstances be administered intravenously.
          <br><br>

          <strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> 0.5ml of reconstituted
          vaccine contains one immunising dose.
          From the age of 12 months up to and including 12 years of age: 1 dose.
          13 years & above: 2 doses with an interval of 6 to 10 weeks.
          The same schedule should be applied for the high-risk patients also. In these patients, periodic measurement of varicella antibodies after vaccination may be indicated in order to identify those who may benefit from revaccination.
          Administration: Varilrix is for subcutaneous use only.<br><br>

          <strong>Drug inter:</strong> Subjects who have received immunoglobulins or a blood transfusion, immunisation should be delayed for at least three months because of the likelihood of vaccine failure due to passively acquired varicella antibodies.
          Varilrix can be administered at the same time as any other vaccines. Different injectable vaccines should always be adiminstered at different injection sites. But, measles vaccine should not be given at the same time as Varilrix, at least at an interval of one month, since it is recognised that measles vaccination may lead to short lived supperssion of the cell mediated immune response. In high-risk patients, Varilrix should not be administered at the same time as other live attenuated vaccines. Inactivated vaccines may be administered in any temporal relationship to Varilrx, given that no specific contra-indications had been established.

           <strong>Ind:</strong> Tritanrix HB is indicated for active immunisation against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and hepatitis B in infants from 6 weeks onwards.
           <br><br>

          <strong>C/I:</strong> Known hyersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, or history of hypersensitivity after administration of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or HB vaccines previously. ii. Acute severe febrile illness. iii. child suffering from encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine. In these circumstances the vaccination course should be continued with DT and Hb vaccines. iv. Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. v. convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days.<br><br>

          <strong>S/E:</strong> Unusual crying, drowsiness, irritability, gastrointestinal symptoms and feeding problems were observed during clinical trials. These events were reported within 48 hours and in less than 5.0% of the cases were considered as severe. Fever was recorded in 40% but in most cases it was mild to moderate. These events lasted only for a few days.Very rare anaphylaxis, allergic reactions including anaphylactoid reactions and serum sickness like disease, have been reported. Convulsions and thrombocyto-penia have been reported very rarely with hepatitis B containing vaccines.Fatigue, malaise, headache, arthralgia, myalgia and urticaria have also been reported. <br><br>

          <strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Persistent crying lasting >3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. There may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits outweigh possible risks.
          Trianrix hepb should under no circums-tances be administered intravenously.<br><br>

          <strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> The recommended dose (0.5ml) of the vaccine must be administered by deep intrmauscular (i.m) injection, preferably in the anterolateral part of thigh. In patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders, the vaccine should be admini-stered subcutaneously. The primary vaccination schedule consists of 3 doses within the first six months of life.<br><br>

          Vaccination schedule & booster dose:<br><br>

          Where hepatitis B vaccine is not given at birth,
          the combined vaccine can be administered beginning as early as 8 weeks of age. Where there is a high endemicity of hepatitis B, the practice to administer hepatitis B vaccine at birth should be continued. In these circums- tances, vaccina-tion with the combined vaccine should start at 6 weeks of age. 3 vaccine doses must be administered at intervals of at least 4 weeks.
          At this moment, insufficient data are available to support the recommendation of a booster dose of the combined vaccine. The administration of a booster dose with DPT vaccine is recommended before the end of the second year of life. For longterm protection, a booster dose of HB vaccine could also be administered after the first year of life. However, the need for this dose is currently not established.
          Vaccination for infants born to HBs Ag+positive mothers:
          In the case of children born of known hepatitis B carrier mothers the immunoprophylactic measures for hepatitis B should not be modified. This may require separate vaccination with hepatitis B and DPT vaccines and also include the administration of HBIg at birth.
          For further information, see below under the text of Hepatitis B vaccine.<br><br>

          <strong>Interaction with other vaccines & drugs:</strong> Previous experiences with simultaneous administration of DPT, OPV and HB vaccines have not shown any interference. no interference in the immune response to any of the antigens was observed as compared to the responses observed following adminis-tration of the vaccines at separate sites.
          In patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate response may not be achieved.
          Shelf-life: The tritanrix HB vaccine should be stored at a temperature between +2°C to +9° C. when the vaccine is stored under prescribed conditions the shelf-life is 36 months.

          <strong>Ind:</strong> Act-HIB is indicated for the prevention, in infants from 2 months, of invasive diseases caused by H. influenzae type b (viz. meningitis, septicaemia, cellulitis, arthritis, epiglottitis etc). Act-HIB does not protect against infections due to other types of H. influenzae, nor against other meningitis of other origins.<br><br>

          <strong>S/E:</strong> No serious local or general reaction observed following administration of the vaccine. The reported local signs/symptoms that occur within the first 48 hours are mild redness, swelling and pain at the site of injection, which resolves spontaneously. The general symptoms that reported within the first 48 hours are fever, loss of appetite, restlessness, vomiting, diarrhoea and unusual crying, wich are also mild and resolves spontaneously.<br><br>

          <strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. For this reason, medical supervision should continue for 30minutes after immunistion.
          Although limited immune response to the tetanus toxoid component may occur, vaccination with ACT HIB alone does not subsitute for rutine tetanus vaccination.<br><br>

          <strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Primary vaccination: from 2 months- 3 injections at 1 or 2 months intervals followed by a booster 12 months after the third dose.
          Second chance vaccination: when it has not been possible to give the child a primary vaccination- (i) between 6 and 12 months: 2 injections at 1 or 2 months intervals followed by a booster 12 months after the second dose; (ii) from 12 months and up to 5 years: a single injection.<br><br>

          <strong>Drug inter:</strong> ACT-HIB can be administered either simultaneously or at any time before or after a different inactivated or live vaccine. Other injectable vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites. In patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or patients with immunodefici-ency, an adequate response may not be achieved.

            <strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> The primary vaccination schedule consists of three doses in the first 6 months of life and can start from the age of 6 weeks. Infants between the ages of 6 and 12 months previously unvaccinated should receive 2 injections, given with an interval of one month, followed by a booster in the second year of life. Previously unvaccinated children aged 1-5 years should be given one dose of vaccine. To ensure a long-term protection, a booster dose is recomme-nded in the second year of life. As vaccination schemes vary from country to country, the schedule for eah country may be used in accordance with the different national recomme-ndations.

            <h3> HEPATITIS-A VIRUS VACCINE: Injection  </h3>
            <p>  Hepatitis A virus vaccine is a purified sterile suspension containing formaldehyde-inactivated hepatitis A virus adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide; the viral antigen content is determined by an ELISA test.<br><br>

            <strong>Mode of action:</strong> 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine' causes active immunisation against hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection.
            <br><br>

            <strong>Ind:</strong> Active immunisation against hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection in subjects at risk of exposure to HAV.<br><br>

            <strong>C/I:</strong> 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine' should not be administered to subjects with known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, or to subjects having shown signs of hypersensitivity after previous administration of 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine'.<br><br>

            <strong>S/E:</strong> 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine' is well-tolerated. Most events reported were mild and did not last for more than 24 hours. The most frequently reported was injection site soreness (less than 0.5% reported as severe) which resolved, besides, mild local redness and swelling with a frequency of about 4% of all vaccinations. The systemic adverse events reported are headache, malaise, vomiting, fever, nausea, and loss of appetite, with a frequency varying between 0.8% and 12.8% of vaccinations, these are all mild & resolved within 24 hours.<br><br>

            <strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine' should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an i.m injection to these subjects. Firm pressure should be applied to the injection site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes.
            As with other vaccines, 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine' should not be given in a subject suffering from acute severe febrile illness. A minor infection, however, is not a contra- indication for vaccination.
            In haemodialysis patients and in subjects with an impaired immune system, adequate anti-Hay antibody titre may not be obtained after a single dose of 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine' and such patients may therefore require administration of additional doses of vaccine.
            As with injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine' can be given to HIV infected persons.
            It is not known whether 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine'
            will prevent hepatis A in such a case, who was infected by hepatitis A virus and was in incubation period at the time of vaccination.<br><br>

             <strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Due to lack of adequate human data on use of 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine' during pregnancy and lactation and lack of adequate animal reproduction studies, it should be used during pregnancy and lactation only when clearly needed.<br><br>

            <strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> See below under individual presentation.
            Instructions for use, handling & disposal of vaccine: The vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or variation of physical appearance prior to administration. Before use of 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine', the vial/syringe should be well shaken to obtain a slightly opaque white suspension. Discard the vaccine if the content appears otherwise.<br><br>

            <strong>Drug inter:</strong> Since ' Hepatitis A virus vaccine' is an inactivated vaccine, its concomitant use with other inactivated vaccines is unlikely to result in interference with the immune responses. Concomitant administration of typhoid, yellow fever, cholera (injectable) or tetanus does not interfere with 'Hepatitis A virus vaccine' immune response. Concomitant administration of immunoglobulins dose not impact the protective effect of the vaccine.

          <h3> HEPATITIS- B Vaccine: Injection.  </h3>
          <p> Hepatitis-B vaccine (yeast derived), prepared by recombinant DNA technique.<br><br>

          <strong>Ind:</strong> 1. Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection (all known subtypes) by active immunization.
          2. Prevention of vertical transmission of Hepatitis B virus infection (should be administered in combination with Hepatitis B immunoglobulin). 3. Protection of transmi-ssion of Hepatitis-B virus infection after acute exposure to blood containing HBs Ag.
          <br><br>

          <strong>C/I:</strong> Hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine.<br><br>

          <strong>Precautions:</strong> 1. Avoid injecting at the site of nerve. 2. Immediately drawout the needle
          when serious pain or back flow of blood into the syringe occurs. Reinject at a different site. <br><br>

          <strong>S/E:</strong> 1. Hypersensitivity. 2. Digestive system- nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite. 3. Psychoneurologic- headache. 4. Others- fatigue, joint pain.
          <br><br>

          <strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> See under individual prepns.
          Vaccination for intants born to HBs Ag+positive mothers:
          Infants born to HBs Ag positive mothers are at high risk of becoming chronic carriers of Hepatitis-B virus & of developing the chronic sequelae of Hepatitis-B virus infection. Results of clinical studies have shown that administration of one 0.5ml dose of Hepatitis- B immune globulin at birth & three 0.5ml (5mcg) doses of Hepatitis-B vaccine, the first dose given within one week after birth, 2nd dose at 1 month & 3rd dose at 6 months of age was 96% effective in preventing establishment of the chronic carrier state in infants born to HBs Ag & HBeAg positive mothers.
          The first dose of Hepatitis-B vaccine may be given at birth at the same time as Hepatitis-B immune globulin, but should be administered in the opposite anterolateral thigh. This procedure may be preferable to ensure absorption of the vaccine.
          Testing for HBsAg & anti-HB, is recommended at 12-15 months to monitor the final success or failure of therapy. If HBsAg is not detectable & anti-HBs is present, the child has been protected.
          Acute exposure to blood containing HBsAg: Hepatitis-B immune globulin 0.06ml/kg should be given as soon as possible after exposure & within 24 hours if possible. Hepatitis-B vaccine 1.0ml (10mcg) should be given i.m within 7 days of exposure & 2nd & 3rd doses given one & six months respectively after the first dose. Site of injection: Preferably into the deltoid muscle in adults & the anterolateral aspect of thigh in infants & young children.
          Time interval: A minimum of one month should seperate successive injections of vaccine. Accelerated regimens (e.g 0, 1 & 2 months or 0, 2 & 4 months) may induce protective antibody earlier in a slightly larger proportion of vaccines. Storage: Store vials at 2-8°C. Storage above or below the recommended temperature may reduce potency. Do not freeze, since freezing destroys potency.<br><br>
          Note: For additional information, please consult manufacturer's literature.  </p>

          <h3>MMR Vaccine: Injection   </h3>
          <p> MMR is a combination vaccine of live measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccine; available as 0.5ml vial (single dose) injection for subcutaneous or intramuscular use.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> 1. It is indicated for combined immunization against measles, mumps & rubella. As a general guide, the first dose of MMR vaccine is administered to children aged from 12 months. A second (booster) dose of MMR or monovalent measles vaccine is recommended before starting school at 3-6 years of age. Children presenting for their pre-school booster who have not received their first dose of MMR vaccine should be given a dose of MMR vaccine then followed by a second dose 3 months later.
2. MMR vaccine can be used in place of measles vaccine for children & should be given irrespective of previous measles, mumps or rubella infection.
3. To control outbreaks of measles and should be offered to susceptible children within 3 days of exposure to infection.
<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> 1. Children with untreated malignant disease or altered immunity, & those receiving immunosuppressive drugs or radiotherapy, or high-dose corticosteroids<br>
2. Children who have received another live
vaccine by injection within 3 weeks. <br>
3. Children with allergies to neomycin or kanamycin.<br>
4. Children with acute febrile illness.<br>
5. If given to women of childbearing age,
pregnancy
should be avoided for 3 months (as for rubella vaccine).<br>
6. Should not be given within 3 months of an immunoglobulin injection.<br>
7. Children with partial or totally impaired immune responsiveness, should not receive any live vaccine.<br>
8. MMR vaccine is not suitable for prophylaxis following exposure to mumps or rubella since the antibody response to the mumps and rubella components is too slow for effective prophylaxis. A/R: Malaise, fever or a rash may occur following the fist dose of MMR vaccine, most commonly about a week after immunisation and lasting about 2 to 3 days, (paracetamol may be given for fever). Nausea, vomiting, & diarrhoea may occasionally occur. Parotid swelling also reported, usually in the third week. rarely local allergic reactions, urticaria anaphylaxis & anaphylactoid reactions may occur. After a second dose of MMR vaccine, adverse reactions are considerably less common than after the first dose. Post- vaccination meningoencephalitis was also reported (rarely and with complete recovery). <br><br>

<strong>Precautions</strong>: 1. Adequate treatment provisions including adrenaline injection should be available for immediate use as in anaphylactic reaction (if any).
2. Children with a personal or close family history of convulsions should be given MMR vaccine, provided the parents understand that there may be a febrile response; doctors should seek specialist paediatric advice rather than withold vaccination; there is increasing evidence that MMR vaccine can be given safely even when the child has had an anaphylactic reaction to food containing egg. <br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> The dosage of vaccine is the same (0.5ml) for all age groups. Inject the total volume of the single dose vial (0.5ml) reconstituted vaccine deef subcutaneously or intramuscularly (do not inject intravenously), preferably into the outer aspect of upper arm. Reconstitute the powder of the vial with the diluent supplied.<br><br>

Storage: Before reconstitution store MMR vaccine at 2-8°C & protect from light.   </p>

          <h3>IMMUNOGLOBULIN PREPNS   </h3>
          <p>  Immunoglobulins are protein molecules that exhibit antibody activity. They are glycoproteins composed of polypeptides (82-96%) and carbohydrates (4-18%). The polypeptide components possess almost all the biological properties associated with the antibody activity. Antibodies are multifunctional molecules. Above all, they bind antigens and initiate a range of secondary phenomena such as complement activation which is independent of their antigen specificity.
There are 5 classes of immunoglobulins- IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, IgE. Among these, IgG comprises about 85% of total serum immunoglobulins.IgG immunoglobulins are formed during the course of the humoral immune response from B- lymphocytes and plasma cells, and are distributed in the extracellular fluid. They are the only antibody class able to cross the placenta. Immunoglobulins are prepared from two origins: 1. Animal origin (known as antisera), were frequently associated with hypersensitivity which led to their virtual abundonment.<br><br>

2. Human immunoglobulins- (which have replaced animal immunoglobulins).
Again human immunoglobulins are of 2 types- i. Normal immunoglobulin & ii. Specific immunoglobulin.
Human Normal Immunoglobulins (HNIG):
These are the gamma globulins, prepared from pools of at least 1000 donations of human plasma; and contains antibody to measles, mumps, hepatitis A, rubella, varicella and other viruses currently prevalent in the general population. Human Specific Immunoglobulins (HSIG): These are the gamma globulins, that are prepared as antibodies against different specific infections, viz. Hepatitis-B immunoglobulin (HBIG),
Rabies immunoglobulin,
Tetanus immunoglobulin (HTIG),
Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) Mechanisms of action of immunoglobulins: Immunoglobulins are the main players of humoral immune activity. They neutralise toxins or viruses, activate complement and stimulate phagocytosis by opsonisation.
In functional terms, immunoglobulins play the role of mediators between the specific recognition and binding of antigens and the activation of unspecific effector mechanisms in the organism. Antigen-specific binding occurs via the variable part of the Fab region of immunoglobulin structure. Immunoglobulin as a bivalent antibody- it has two antibody binding sites allows a three-dimensional cross-linking of antigens. They play an important role in the counter- regulation of autoantibody formation by lymphocytes  </p>

          <h3>  HEPABIG Inj. Green Cross Corp./Tajarat </h3>
          <p> Hepabig injection is a sterile solution containing hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) which is prepared by Cohn fractionation from plasma of human individuals with high titres of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and whose plasma does not show serologic evidence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Also, donors are always checked up to exclude HIV and HCV infection before preparation of Hepabig. hepabig injection contains, the specific antibody titre against the HBsAg- Hepatitis B immune
globulin 200 i.u/ml.
Pharmacological action: Hepatitis B immune globulin is used to provide passive immunity to hepatitis B infection in the prophylactic treatment of individuals exposed to hepatitis B virus of HBsAg positive materials. Antibodies specific to HBsAg (anti-HBs), which are present in Hepabig combine with HBsAg and neutralize the hepatitis B virus, so that its infective or pathogenic properties are inhibited. <br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> 1. Prophylaxis in neonates born to HBsAg positive mothers. 2. Post-exposure prophylaxis following percutaneous exposure to (e.g needlestick), direct mucous membrane contact with (e.g oral, ophthalmic), or ingestion (e.g pipetting accident) of material containing hepatitis B virus or an HBsAg positive source of known identity. 3. Post-exposure prophylaxis following sexual or intimate contacts to an HBsAg positive individual.
<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Hepabig should not be administered to HBsAg positive individuals. But, no adverse reactions have been seen in individuals with pre- existing hepatitis B surface antigen altho-ugh data regarding this occurrence are limited.
<br><br>

A/R: Adverse reactions are infrequent, mild, and transient following administration of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). Local pain and tenderness at the injection site, urticaria and angioedema may occur.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions</strong>: Should not be administered intravenously. Should be given with caution to patients with a history of prior systemic allergic reaction following the administration of human immune globulin preparation. Should be given with caution to patients with Ig A deficiency syndrome, since these individuals may have serum antibodies to Ig A and anaphylaxis could result from following administration of blood products containing Ig A. Following the administration of Hepabig, the application of live virus vaccine should be avoided for a period of 3 months because the antibody
content of Hepabig may interfere with the immune response to the vaccination.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Hepabig should only be administered by intramuscular injection. Following exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV), should be administered within 7 days (preferably within 48 hours) and, if necessary, repeated the same or increased quantity of dose. The recommended dose for adult is 1,000 to 2,000 I.0
In prophylaxis in neonates born to HBsAg positive mothers, should be injected within 5 days after birth (preferably within 48 hours) and repeated after fifteen days or 2/3 months after the first administration. The recommended initial dose is 100 to 200 I.0 (0.5 to 1ml) and booster dose is 32 to 48 I.0 per kg of body weight.
Although post-exposure prophylaxis with 'hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG)' alone was previously recommended for neonates born to HBsAg positive women, combined passive immunization with HBIG and active immunization with hepatitis B virus vaccine is currently recommended in these neonates. Storage: Store below 10°C without freezing. Maximum validity: 24 months.

Human anti-tetanus immunoglobulin is a liquid or lyophilized concentrate for intramuscular administration prepared from pooled human plasma of donors who have been immunized against tetanus and who have received a booster injection of tetanus vaccine prior to donation. Human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is available in vials, ampoules or preloaded syringe for instant administration.
<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Passive immunisation against tetanus in non- vaccinated individual or treatment for declared tetanus. Sustained wounds possibly contaminated with tetanus bacilli.
In all cases of passive immunization, tetanus vaccine (adsorbed) should be administered as soon as practicable.
<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Slight local reactions like inflammation and tenderness may occur.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Prophylaxis: In case of injury, thorough debridement and cleansing of the wound should be performed. Prompt i.m administration of 250 i.u.(1m1) of TIG is usually adequate. (Child- 4 units/kg body weight).
In severe multiple injuries or of a highly potential tetanus infectivity the dose should be doubled.
Passive immunization with immunoglobulin should be accompanied by simultaneous active immunization with adsorbed tetanus vaccine with seperate syringe & into saperate site. TIG usually provides a protective level of tetanus antitoxin over 0.01 i.0 per ml serum for a period of 4 wks.<br><br>

Treatment: TIG could be used for the treatment of declared tetanus in conjunction with other therapeutic measures. The doses would range between 3,000 i.u. and 6,000 i.u.   </p>
