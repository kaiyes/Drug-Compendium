          <h3> CALCITONIN  </h3>
          <p> Calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland in mammals. It is involved with parathyroid hormone in the regulation of bone turnover and hence in the maintenance of calcium balance and homoeostasis. It is normaly
present in blood, and its concentration increases when the calcium concentration is excessive as after eating or when calcium salts are administered. It inhibits bone resorption leading to hypocalcemia- an effect more apparent in children and patients with Paget's disease than in normal adults.
Synthetic calcitonin is used clinically to treat Paget's disease and hypercalcemia, and it has also been tried in postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment.   </p>

          <h3> SALMON CALCITONIN </h3>
          <p>  Salmon calcitonin, a synthetic calcitonin hormone; available in injection and nasal spray form. <strong>Mode of action:</strong> Calcitonin has a hypocalcemic action by direct inhibition of bone resorption by osteoclastic cells. Among the available types of calcitonin, including synthetic human, synthetic salmon calcitonin is the most potent. Salmon calcitonin is used in the treatment of selected patients with diseases characterized by increased bone resorption, such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans) and Sudeck's disease of bone.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> 1. Osteoporosis of different types- i. Post- menopausal osteoporosis, ii. Senile osteoporosis, iii. Secondary osteoporosis.
2. Paget's disease of bone. 3. Sudecks's disease of bone. 4. Hypercalcemia, due to osteolysis in course of breast, lung and renal cancers and other malignancies.
5. Hyperparathyroidism & vitamin D intoxication and 6. also in the treatment of bone pain due to metastatic cancers.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Salmon calcitonin must not be administered in cases of suspected pregnancy or during lactation. Clinical hypersensitivity to salmon calcitonin.<br><br>

<strong>A/R:</strong> By injection: In some cases nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, face redness and heat sensation have been reported. These reactions usually disappear spontaneously as treatment progresses. There can be occasionally inflammatory reactions at the injection site. Troublesome side effects may be reduced by bed- time administration. Anti-emetics may be used if necessary during treatment.<br><br>

By nasal spray: The incidence of systemic side- effects is much lower than by injection. Local side effects, such as rhinorrhea, mucosal dryness, nasal obstructions, sneezing & hyposmia may appear, but these effects usually do not require withdrawal of the treatment as they generally regress spontaneously.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> In very rare cases, salmon calcitonin, being a polypeptide, can give rise to hypersensitive reactions either local or general; in the cases of such reactions, the treatment must be stopped and, if necessary, substitute by a suitable treatment. Salmon calcitonin must not be administered in cases of suspected pregnancy or during lactation.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & Admin:</strong>
Osteoporosis: Injection: 50-100 IU/day, s.c or i.m together with calcium and vitmain D supplementation. In some cases, the injection can be administered on alternate days. If necessary, the dosage can be increased to 200 IU/day. Intranasal spray: 100-200 IU/day depending on severity of the disease, together with calcium & vitamin D supplementation. In case of giving 100 IU/day, one spray a day, alter nating nostrils daily. In case of giving 200 IU/day, two sprays a day, one in the morning and one in the evening, alternating nostrils. Paget's disease: Injection: 50-100 IU/day, s.c or i.m. In some cases, the injection can be administered on alternate days. If necessary, the dosage can be increased to 200 IU/day. Intranasal spray: 200 IU/day; two sprays a day, one in the morning and one in the evening, alternating nostrils.
Treatment should be at least 3 months irrespective of the route of administration.
Dosage may be adjusted to the individual requirements.
Hypercalcemia (following cancers & hyperparathyroidism): Hypercalcemic crisis: Injection: 5-10 IU/kg/day over a period of at least 6 hours in i.v drip (most preferred & effective method) or by slow i.v injection in 2-4 divided doses.
Chronic hypercalcemia: Injection: 5-10 IU/kg/day, s.c or i.m in one or two divided doses. The treatment should be adapted to clinical and biochemical reaction of the patient. Intranasal spray: 200-400 IU/day depending on severity of the condition, alternating nostrils. Sudecks's disease: Injection: 50-100 IU/day, s.c or i.m. In some cases, the injection can be administered on alternate days. If necessary, the dosage can be increased to 200 IU/day. Intranasal spray: 100-200 IU/day depending on severity of the disease. In case of giving 100 IU/day, one spray a day, alternating nostrils daily. In case of giving 200 IU/day, two sprays a day, one in the morning and one in the evening, alternating nostrils.
Bone pain due to metastatic cancers: Injection: 50-100 IU/day, s.c or i.m. Intranasal spray: 100-200 IU/day depending on severity of the disease.
In case of giving 100 IU/day, one spray a day, alternating nostrils daily. In case of giving 200 IU/day, two sprays a day, one in the morning and one in the evening, alternating nostrils.
Irrespective of the route of administration, dosage should be adjusted to individual requirements.<br><br>

<strong>Overdose:</strong> High doses of salmon calcitonin can provoke a notable hypocalcemia, which should be corrected by administrating calcium. However, no serious consequences due to overdose have yet been reported. An overdose of 1000 IU by s.c injection, may produce nausea and vomiting as the only adverse effect.

          <h3> ALENDRONATE  </h3>
          <p>  Alendronate sodium is a non-hormonal compound belonging to the bisphosphonate group, used in bone formation specially in osteoporosis in old ages.<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> At the cellular level alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specially under osteoclasts. It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it inhibits osteoclast activity. It reduces bone turnover i.e the number of sites at which bone is remolded. In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these molding sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> 1. Treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. 2. For the prevention of osteoporosis. 3. Treatment of Paget's disease of bone.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Abnormalities of the oesophagus which can delay oesophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia. Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes. Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Hypocalcaemia.<br><br>

<strong>S/E: </strong> Usually mild and not require discontinuation of therapy. Side-effects include- oesophageal reactions, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhoea or constipation, flatulence, musculoskeletal pain, headache, rash, erythema and transient decrease in serum calcium and phosphate.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions:</strong> Hypocalcaemia and other disturbances of mineral metabolism should be corrected before initiation of therapy.
Alendronate can cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa, and there is a potential for worsening of the underlying disease. Caution should be adoptet when alendronate is given to the patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems, such as dysphagia, oesophageal disease, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers. Patients should stop taking medicine and consult their physician if they develop oesophageal diseases, such as difficulty or pain upon swallowing, retrosternal pain, new or worsening heart burn.No dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly or for patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 35 to 60 ml/min). Alendronate is not recommended for patients with more severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 35ml).
<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> Alendronate has not been studied in pregnant and breast feeding women, and hence should not be given to them. <br><br>

<STRONG>Dosage and Admin:</STRONG> Post-menopausal osteoporosis: 10mg once daily.
Paget's disease of bone: 40mg once daily for 6 months.
To permit adequate absorption, alendronate tablet must be taken in an empty stomach with a full glass of water, at least 30 minutes before the breakfast or first food or drink or medication of the day. Patients should stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes after taking the alendronate tablet & do not lie down until after eating breakfast. Patients should not chew or suck on the tablet &don't take the tablet at bed time.<br><br>

Children- not recommended.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Calcium supplement, antacids and some oral medications will interfere with absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time. Intravenous ranitidine makes the bioavailability of oral alendronate double. Incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with NSAID and aspirin appears to be greater with concomitant administration of alendronate.

           <h3> BONDRONAT Inj. Biotech/Roche (IBANDRONIC ACID) </h3>
           <p> Ibandronic acid monosodium salt, monohydrate corresponding to ibandronic acid 2mg (2ml) concentrate vial & 6mg (6ml) concentrate vial: injection.<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Ibandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonates belonging to the nitrogen- containing group of bisphosphonates, which acts on the bone tissue & specifically inhibit osteoclast activity without directly affecting bone formation. It dose not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. The selective action of ibandronic acid on bone tisssue is based on the high affinity of this compound for hydroxyapatite, which represents the mineral matrix of the bone.
Ibandronic acid reduces bone resorption, with no direct effect on bone formation.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) of advanced malignancies. Treatment of
hypercalcemia of malignancy.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Ibandronic acid must not be used in known
hypersensitivity to the drug substance and in severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >5mg/dl or 442mmol/l). Caution is indicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to other bisphosphonates. Ibandronic acid concentrate for solution for infusion should not be used in children because of lack of clinical experience.<br><br>

 <strong>S/E: </strong> Intravenous administration of ibandronic acid concentrate was most commonly associated with a rise in body temperature. Occasionally, a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, chills, bone and/or muscle ache like pain was reported. In most cases no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after a couple of hours/days. Frequently, the decreased renal calcium excretion is accompanied by a fall in serum phosphate levels not requiring therapeutic measures. The serum calcium level may fall to hypocalcaemic values. Gastrointestinal intolerability has been reported in a few isolated cases. Administration of other bisphosphonates has been associated with broncho-constriction in acetylsalicylic acid-sensitive asthmatic patients. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction, caution: is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, since both agents can lower serum calcium levels for prolonged periods. Attention should also be paid to the possible existence of simultaneous hypomagnesaemia. <br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Serum calcium, phosphate and magnesium must be closely monitored in patients treated with ibandronic acid concentrate for solution for infusion. Clinical data are available on its wide range of renal safety. As no clinical data are available, dosage recommendations cannot be given for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. Overhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> Ibandronic acid preparation should not be used during pregnancy and nursing mothers as sufficient data are not available.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & Admin:</strong> In general patients with osteolytic bone metastases require lower doses than patients with the humoral type of hypercalcaemia. In patients with mild to moderate hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium less than 3mmol/l or less than 12mg/dI) 2mg is an effective dose. In most patients with severe hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium =3mmol/l or =12mg/dl) 4mg will be an adequate dosage. The highest dose used in clinical trials was 6mg but this dose does not add any further benefit in terms of efficacy. Adults & elderly: Prior to treatment with ibandronic acid the patient should be adequately rehydrated with 0.9% sodium chloride. Consideration should be given to the severity of the hypercalcaemia as well as the tumour type.<br><br>

            <h3> BONVIVA Tab. Roche  </h3>
            <p>One 150mg film-coated tablet contains 168.75mg of ibandronic acid monosodium salt, monohydrate equivalent to 150mg ibandronic acid.<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Please see above under the text of ‘bondronat injection'.
In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover towards premenopausal levels leading to a progressive net gain in bone mass.<br><br>

 <strong>Ind:</strong> Ibandronic acid is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, to reduce the risk of fractures.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Bonviva is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients.<br><br>

<strong>A/R:</strong> In a one-year study in postmenopausal. women with osteoporosis treated with bonviva (ibandronic acid) 150mg once monthly, the majority of adverse drug reactions observed, were mild to moderate in intensity, and most cases did not lead to cessation of therapy. The common adverse reactions (>1/10) were- dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain & diarrhoea; headache; myalgia; skin rash & influenza like illness. <br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Hypocalcemia & other disturbances of bone & mineral metabolism should be effectively treated before starting bonviva therapy. Adequate intake of calcium & vitamin D is important in all paitents. Bisphosphonates have been associated with dysphagia, esophagitis, & esophageal or gastric ulcer. Therefore, patients should pay particular attention & be able to comply with the dosing instructions.Physicians should be alert to sings or symptoms signalling a possible esophageal reaction during therapy, and patients should be instructed to discontinue therapy & seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of esophageal irritation, such as new or worsening dysphagia, pain on swallowing, retrosternal pain, or heart burn. Since NSAIDs & bisphosphonates are both associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during concomitant medication with bonviva.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> Bonviva should not be used during pregnancy & lactation.
<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & Admin:</strong> The recommended dose of ibandronic acid for treatment is 150mg (one film-coated tablet) once a month. The tablet should preferably be taken on the same date each month.<br><br>

<STRONG>Method of administration:</STRONG> Ibandronic acid should be taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day or any other oral medicine or supplementation (including calcium). Tablet should be swallowed whole with a full glass of plain water (180- 240ml) while the patient is sitting or standing in an upright position. Patients must not lie down for 60 munites after taking bonviva (ibandronic acid). Plain water is the only drink that should be taken with bonviva. (Some mineral waters may have a higher concentration of calcium & therefore should not be used). Patients should not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.
Pateints should receive supplemental calcium or vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. Missed dose: In case a once- monthly dose is missed, patients should be instructed to take bonviva (ibandronic acid) 150mg tablet in the next morning of remembering the dose, unless the time to the next scheduled dose is within 7 days. Patients should then return to taking their dose once a month on their originally scheduled date. If the next scheduled dose is within 7 days, pateints should wait until their next dose & then continue taking one tablet once a month as originally scheduled. Patients should not take two tablets within the same week.
Special dosage instructions: Patients with hepatic impairment- no dose adjustment is necessary. Patients with renal impairment- no dose adjustment is necessary with mild or moderate renal impairment where creatinine clearance is equal to or greater than 30ml/min; below 30ml/min creatinine clearance, the decision to administer bonviva should be based on an individual risk-benefit assessment. Elderly- no dose adjustment is necessary.<br><br>

<STRONG>Children:</STRONG> Safety & efficacy have not been established in patients less than 18 years old. <strong>Drug inter:</strong> It is likely that calcium supplements, antacids & some oral medications containing multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium ion) are likely to interfere with absorption of ibandronic acid. Therefore, patients must wait 60 minutes after taking bonviva (ibandronic acid before taking other oral medications.<br><br>

          <p>   Risedronate sodium is a non-hormonal compound belonging to the bisphosphonate group, used in bone formation specially in osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in old ages.<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Risedronate has an affinity for hydroxyapetite crystats in bone and acts as an antiresorptive agent. At the cellular level, risedronate inhibits osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface, but show evidence of reduced active resorption (e.g lack of ruffled border). Histomorphometry in rats, dogs and mini pigs showed that risedronate treatment reduces bone turnover (activation frequency, i.e the rate at which bone remodeling sites are activated) and bone resorption at remodeling sites. <br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Risedronate is intended for the use in the following conditions. 1. Treatment of established postmenopausal osteoporosis; prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with increased risk of osteoporosis. 2. Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis associated with glucocorticoid therapy (daily dosage equivalent to 7.5mg or greater of prednisone) for chronic inflammatory disease.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Known hypersensitivity to risedronate sodium or to any of its ingredients. Hypocalcaemia (a low blood calcium level). Pregnancy and lactation. Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30ml/min).<br><br>

<strong>S/E: </strong> Risedronate may induce some undesirable effects in some patients, which were found mild to moderate. Among these, most common side effects are pain in bones, muscles, joints and stomach ache. In a small number of patients, the following uncommon side effects have been reported- inflammation of small intestine (duodenitis), tongue (glossitis) and inflammation of the coloured part of the eye (iritis). Early transient asymptomatic and mild decreases in serum calcium and phosphate levels have been reported in some patients.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> In patients who have a history of oesophageal disorders which delay oesophageal transit or emptying (e.g stricture or achalasia) or who are unable to stay in the upright position for at least after taking the tablet. Hypocalcaemia should be treated before starting risedronate therapy, other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism (e.g parathyroid dysfunction, hypo-vitaminosis D) should be treated at the time of risedronate therapy. In patients who have a lack of vitamin D or problem with the parathyroid glands, risedronate should be used with special caution.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> Risedronate must not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & Admin:</strong> The recommended daily dose is 5mg (1 tablet) orally.The absorption of risedronate is affected by foods and drinks, so, this should not be taken with food or drinks other than water. Take the dose (1 tablet) once daily, either at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water of the day). Or at least 2 hours from any food or drink at any other time of the day, and at least 30 minutes before going to bed. Supplemental calcium and vitamin D should be considered if the dietary intake is inadequate.In all cases including duration of treatment physician's prescription and advice must be strictly followed.<br><br>

Children: Safety and efficacy of risedronate have not been established in children and adolescents.<br><br>

<strong>Overdosage:</strong> In case of overdosage or accidental intoxication one should drink a full glass of milk and immediately contact physician or hospital. Decreases in serum calcium following substantial overdose may be expected. Signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia may also occur in some of those patients. Milk or antacids containing magnesium, calcium or aluminium should be given to bind risedronate sodium and reduce absorption of the drug. Incase of substantial overdose, gastric lavage may be considered to remove unabsorbed drug.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> If considered appropriate, risedronate may be used concomitantly with oestrogen supplementation. Concomitant ingestion of products containing calcium, magnesium, iron and aluminium may interfere with the absorption of risedronate. These products should be taken at different times of the day apart from risedronate dose. Risedronate is not systemically metabolized, does not induce P450 enzymes and has low protein binding. </p>

          <h3> RALOXIFENE HCl  </h3>
          <p>  Raloxifene is a drug of miscellaneous group, which helps in bone formation by inhibiting bone resorption. This is therefore, useful in the treatment & prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis.<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptor. This results in activation of certain estrogenic pathways and blockade of others. Raloxifene reduces resorption of bone and decreases overall bone turnover. These effects on bone are manifested as reductions in the serum and urine levels of bone turnover markers. Clinical trials and data suggest that raloxifene lacks estrogen like effects on the uterus and breast tissues. <strong>Ind:</strong> Treatment and prevention of post- menopausal osteoporosis.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Hepatic & renal impairment. In active or past history of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and retinal vein thrombosis. Hypersensitivity to raloxifene or any other constituents of the formulation.<br><br>

<strong>S/E: </strong> Raloxifene is generally well tolerated. However, a few side effects like hot flushes, leg cramps, and influenza like symptoms, gastro- intestinal disturbances etc may be seen usually during first 6 months of treatment. <strong>Precautions:</strong> Concurrent estrogen therapy: concomitant use of raloxifene with systemic estrogens is not recommended.<br>
Lipid metabolism: concomitant use of raloxifene and lipid-lowering agents has not been studied.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & Lactation:</strong> Raloxifene should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant. It is not known whether raloxifene is excreted in breast milk, therefore, lactating mother should not use raloxifene.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & Admin:</strong> 60mg once daily orally, without regard to meal. High fat meal increases the absorption of raloxifene.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Co-administration with cholestyramin, ampicillin and amoxicillin may reduce the absorption of raloxifene.
