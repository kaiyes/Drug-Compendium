            <h3>XELODA Tab. Roche (CAPECITABINE)</h3>
            <p>Capecitabine 500mg/tablet.It is a unique, tumour-activated, oral therapy, for patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid cancers.<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Following absorption through the intestine, capecitabine is converted to 5- fluorouracil through three steps of enzymatic action- initially in the liver cells and then either in the liver or in the tumour cells by two enzyme action, viz. carboxylesterase & cytidine deaminase respectively & finally in the tumour by the action of enzyme 'thymidine phosphorylase' (TP). 5- fluorouracil is then incorporated into tumour cell DNA and RNA and inhibits thymidylate synthetase and consequently tumour cells proliferation.<br><br>

        <strong>Ind:</strong> Capecitabine is indicated as first-line therapy in advanced colorectal cancer. Treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer resistant to both paclitaxel and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen or resistant to paclitaxel and for whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated.<br><br>

        <strong>C/I:</strong> Known hypersensitivity to capecitabine or fluoropyrimidine. It is also contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30ml/min).<br><br>

       <strong>S/E:</strong>Capecitabine is generally well tolerated. Commonly capecitabine causes low incidence of myelosuppression, hair loss, neurological toxicity, and nausea & vomiting. The majority of adverse effects occur during the first cycle of therapy.The incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities in a clinical study is shown as following- diarrhea (14%), hand-foot syndrome (10%), fatigue and stomatitis (7%), neutropenia (3%), neurotoxicity (1%), alopecia (0%). (Hand-foot syndrome is redness or
        erythema and discomfort of the palms and soles).<br><br>

         <strong>Precautions:</strong> Patients receiving therapy with capecitabine should be monitored by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents.
        Most adverse events are reversible and do not require permanent discontinuation of therapy, although doses may need to be withheldor reduced.<br><br>

        <strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Capecitabine is not recommened in pregnant women. It should also be avoided in a nursing mother unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the nursing infant. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with capecitabine.<br><br>

         <strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Capecitabine tablets are administered orally with water, and are given within 30 minutes after a meal. The total daily dose of capecitabine is to be given into two divided doses (morning and evening). Intermittent therapy- the recommended dosage for capecitabine monotherapy is 2500mg/m2/day (maximum tolerated dose as 3000mg/m2/day) for 3 two weeks cycle with an interval of one-week rest following each cycle. The patients responding to initial (3 cycle) therapy should continue capecitabine till they maintain tumour response or stable disease. Continuous therapy- the maximum tolerated dose for capecitabine monotherapy is 1650mg/m2/day as continuous schedule. The rest period is avoided in continuous therapy. There is no need for prior adjustment of the dose for mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases.<br><br>

        Combination dose with docetaxel- 2500mg/m2/day for 1-14 days can be given with 75mg/m2 ofdocetaxelforonceinthereeweeks. Combination dose with paclitaxel- 1650mg/m2/ day for day 1-14 (using the intermittent schedule) can be safely administered with paclitaxel175mg/m2 (every3weeks)regardless of the extent of prior therapy.<br><br>

        <strong>Drug inter:</strong> Capecitabine and its metabolites do not significantly bind with plasma proteins. Capecitabine does not induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. It is therefore unlikely that capecitabine will interact with other pharmaceutical agents. Capecitabine can be administered concomitantly with antacids, antihistamines, NSAIDs, morphine, paracetamol, antiemetics, and H2 antagonists without clinically significant effects.<br>

            <h3>CYTARABINE Inj. Choongwae/NTS</h3>
            <p>Cytarabine (Cytosine arabinoside) 100mg/5ml vial: Injection for i.v infusion.<br><br>

        <strong>Mode of action:</strong> Cytarabine is a cytotoxic antimetabolite. It's exact mechanism of action is unknown. In the body, cytarabine is converted to cytarabine triphosphate which inhibits the synthesis of DNA (by interfering with pyrimidine synthesis- a component of DNA) by inhibiting DNA polymerise.<br><br>

        <strong>Ind:</strong> Predominant use in the induction of remission of acute myelocytic leukaemia. Used singly or in combination therapy with other chemotherapeutic agents for the remission induction in lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, erythroleukaemia and in the treatment and maintenance therapy of meningeal leukaemia and other meningeal neoplasma.<br><br>

        <strong>C/I:</strong> Cytarabine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug.<br><br>

        <strong>A/R:</strong> The major adverse effect of cytarabine is haematologic toxicity.
        Myelosuppressinon is manifested by megaloblastosis, leucopenia, anaemia, reticulopenia and thrombocytopenia. The severity of these adverse effects depend on the dose and the schedule of administration.
        Nausea and vomiting usually occur more frequently following rapid i.v administration as opposed to continuous infusion of the drug. Other adverse effects of the GI tract include- anorexia, diarrhoea, oral and anal inflmmation, abdominal pain, oesophagitis, sore throat, oesophageal ulceration and GI haemorrhage. Due to its immunosuppressive effect viral,
        bacterial, fungal and parasitic infection may occur. Hepatic dysfunction characterised by jaundice, elevation in serum bilirubin, transaminase and alkaline phosphatases have also ocurred.
        Other less major adverse effects include- fever, rash, conjuctivitis, alopecia, chest pain, dizziness, myalgia, bone pain, hyperuricaemia, cardiac and respiratory distress etc.
        Use in lactation: Women should be advised not to breast-feed while being treated with cytarabine. <br><br>

        <strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Single drug therapy in the induction of remission in adults with acute myelocytic leukaemia:
        Cytarabine 200mg/m2 daily by continuous i.v infusion over 24 hrs for 5 days (120 hrs)- total dose 1000mg/m2.
        The course is repeated every 2 weeks. Modifications based on haematologic response should be made. Clinical experience to date indicates that success with cytarabine therapy depends more on adeptness in modifying day to day dosage to obtain maximum leukaemia cell kill with tolerable toxicity. Therefore dosage of cytarabine must be based on clinical and haematologic response & tolerance of the patient.
        Cytarabine can be administered intravenously either as a bolus push or as a continuous infusion. It may also be administered subcutaneously or intrathecally.
        Cytarabine combination therapy: Plesae see package insert.<br><br>

        <strong>Drug inter:</strong> To be cautious when using other myelosuppressive drugs concurrently as the incidence and severity of haemotologic toxicity may be exacerbated.
        Patient may develop acute pancreatitis during cytarabine treatment if he had prior treatment with L-asparaginase.

          <h3> METHOTREXATE: Tablet/Injection  </h3>
          <p> Methotrexate is a folate antagonist. It is used widely & effectively as an antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent. It is also useful in the treatment of psoriasis. Recently, methotrexate is widely used as a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug, that is suitable for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.Methotrexate is available as 2.5mg & 10mg oral tablet and 50mg vial for parenteral injection. <br><br>

          <strong>Mode of action:</strong> Methotrexate inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, essential for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines and thus DNA and RNA synthesis are interrupted. Folate antagonists kill cells during the Sphase of the cell cycle.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> As antineoplastic drug: Breast carcinoma, trophoblastic tumours, choriocarcinoma, hydatidiform mole. Palliative treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas & a number of solid tumours. Therapy for established case of meningeal carcinoma or lymphoma.As disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD): Now a days, methotrexate is widely used as a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) that is suitable for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.
In psoriasis treatment: It is also useful in the
treatment of psoriasis.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Pregnancy; Renal or hepatic impairment; Severe anaemia, leucopenia, thrombocyto-penia, bone marrow aplasia.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> See under Alkeran and also mucositis. <strong>Precautions:</strong> See under Alkeran & also reduce dose in renal failure ( kidney is its main route of excretion.); dose related toxicity in hepatic impairment; avoid when serous effusions exist, as it will accumulate in them & subsequently leak out causing myelosuppression;<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> By injection:<br>
Adult & Child: Trophoblastic tumour: 15-30mg
i.m daily for 5 days, repeat after a period of 1 or more weeks, when all toxic effects have disappeared. In general 3 to 5 courses of therapy will be given.

          <h3> FOLINIC ACID  </h3>
          <p>  Folinic acid is available as calcium salt in water for i.m or i.v injection & tablet as oral preparation. <br><br>

          <strong>Mode of action:</strong> Folinic acid is the formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid which is a metabolite and active form of folic acid. It is effective in the treatment of megaloblastic anaemia caused by folic acid deficiency and is a potent antidote for both the haematopoietic and reticuloendothelial toxic effects of folic acid antagonists e.g methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim. In some cancers, folinic acid enters and rescues normal cells, in preference to tumour cells, from the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, due to a difference in membrane transport mechanism. This principle is applied in high-dose methotrexate therapy with 'folinic acid rescue'. <br><br>

          <strong>Ind:</strong> Calcium folinate is indicated in- i. neutralising the immediate toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, e.g methotrexate, (thus speed recovery from methotrexate-induced mucositis or myelosuppression). ii. The treatment of megaloblastic anaemias due to folic acid deficiency, e.g in sprue, malnutrition, pregnancy, infancy, liver disease and malabsorption syndromes. iii. Folinic acid rescue, i.e using calcium folinate in conjunction with folic acid antagonists, e.g methotrexate, to minimise systemic toxicity.It does not counteract the antibacterial activity of folate antagonists such as trimethoprim.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Calcium folinate is contraindiated in the treatment of Vitmin-B12 deficiency anaemias i.e pernicious anaemia or other megaloblastic anaemias where vitamin-B12 is deficient.<br><br>

<strong>A/R:</strong> Occasional allergic reactions have been reported; pyrexia has occurred after parenteral administration.<br><br>

Caution: Avoid simultaneous administration of methotrexate. <br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Controlled human studies have demonstrated no foetal risks. Since it is not known whether folinic acid is excreted into breast milk, it should be used with caution in nursing mothers.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Folinic acid may be given orally or parenterally by i.m or i.v injection or i.v infusion. When required for intravenous infusion, it may be diluted in 1 litre of 5% w/v glucose in water or normal saline.
Antidote to methotrexate (Folinic acid rescue):
In general, folinic acid should not be administered simultaneously with systemic methotrexate because the therapeutic effect of the antimetabolite may be nullified. However, when methotrexate is administered by intrathecal injection, folinic acid may be given i.m, i.v or orally concomitantly to offest systemic methotrexate without abolishing the local activity of the antineoplastic drug.
As part of a high-dose methotrexate regimen in cancer chemotherapy, 'folinic acid rescue' therapy should begin 8-24 hours after the beginning of methotrexate administration. Generally, doses up to 120mg have heen given over 12-24 hours by i.m, or i.v injection or i.v infusion, followed by 12-15mg i.m or 15mg orally, every 6 hours for the next 48 hours. With lower doses of methotrexate, 15mg folinic acid orally every hours for 48-72 hours may be sufficient.
Treatment of overdose of folic acid antagonists:
In cases of overdosage of folic acid antagonist, folinic acid may be administered by i.v infusion in doses up to 75mg within 12 hours, followed by 12mg i.m every 6 hours for 4 doses. In general, where overdosage is suspected, the dose of folinic acid should be equal to or higher than the offending dose of the folic acid antagonist administered, and should be given as soon as possible; preferably within the first hour, after which it is much less effective.
Treatment of megaloblastic anaemia: 15mg orally daily both adult and children. <br><br>

Over<strong>Dosage:</strong> Doses of calcium folinates as high as 5000mg have been administered with no apparent adverse effects. Such doses suggest that administration of this drug is relatively safe. Signs of excessive dosing, if they occur, should be treated symptomatically.<br><br>

          <p>  Etoposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin used in the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases. It is available as etoposide 20mg/ml; 5ml (100mg) vial: injection<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> The predominant effect of etoposide appears to be DNA synthesis inhibiton, prodably caused by interaction with topoisomerase II. It does not interfere with microtubular assembly. <br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> small cell carcinoma of the bronchus, the lymphomas and testicular tumors, in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.
<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Myelosuppression, hypersen-sitivity to etoposide or one of the other constituents.<br><br>

<strong>A/R:</strong> Myelosuppression (is dose limiting & bone marrow recovery is usually complete by day 21, & no cumulative toxicity has heen reported); anaphylactic-like reactions; alopecia (reversible); transient hypotension following rapid i.v administration is reported in 1% to 2% of patients. Other effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis, peripheral neuropathy, increased liver function tests with high doses, radiation recall dermatitis have been reported.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Repeated bone-marrow study both druing and after therapy. platelet count below 50,000/mm3 or an absolute neutropphil count below 500/mm3 is an indication to withold futher therapy until the blood counts have sufficiently recovered. Etoposide is intendend for i.v administration only. Extravations results in a severe and progressive tissue necrosis. If extravasation occurs, stop immediately and restarted in another vein. Cooling, flooding with normal saline and local infiltration with corticosteroids have been reported as therapeutic measures. Avoid any contact with Etoposide during handling.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Etoposide injection for infusion must be diluted prior to use with either 5% dextrose in water, or 0.9% sodium chloride solution to give a final concentration of 0.2 or 0.4mg/ml. If solutions are prepared at concentrations above 0.4mg/ml, precipitation may occur. The usual dose of etoposide in combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents, ranges from 100- 120mg/m2/day for 3-5 days. Chemotherapy courses are repeated at 3 to 4 week intervals after adequate recovery from any toxicity. In patients with renal function impairment the dose should be lowered. Etoposide is intended for i.v administration only. To prevent the occurrence of hypotension, the infusion should be given over at least 30-60 minutes.<br><br>

Over<strong>Dosage:</strong> The management of bone marrow depression is symptomatic, including antibiotics and transfusions.

            <p>Bevacizumab 25mg/ml; 4ml (100mg) vial: Injection.<br><br>

            <strong>Ind:</strong> Bevacizumab in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is
             indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum.<br><br>

            <strong>C/I:</strong> Bevacizumab is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of the product (chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human or humanised antibodies).<br><br>

           <strong>S/E:</strong> Common adverse events of any grade that were identified as possibly bevacizumab related toxicities were anorexia, constipation, epistaxis, hypertension, proteinuria and pain. Patients
            treated with bevacizumab with or without chemotherapy in any trials included decreased neutrophil count, decreased white blood count, protein urine present, decreased blood potassium, decreased blood phosphorus, increased blood glucose and increased blood alkaline phosphatase. <br><br>

            <strong>Precautions:</strong> Hypertension: Caution should be exercised before initiated bevacizumab therapy in these patients. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during bevacizumab therapy. Wound healing: It is recommended that bevacizumab therapy not be initiated within 28 days following major surgery as such patients were excluded from clinical trials.<br><br>

            <strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Bevacizumab should not be used during pregnancy. In women with childbearing potential, appropriate contraceptive measures are recommended during bevacizumab therapy. Women should be advised to discontinue nursing during bevacizumab therapy and not to breast feed for at least 6 months following the last dose of the therapy.
            <br><br>

            <strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> The recommended dose of bevacizumab is 5mg/kg of body weight given once every 14 days as an intravenous infusion. Bevacizumab should be prepared by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique. Withdraw the volume of bevacizumab equivalent to a dose of 5mg/kg body weight and dilute in a total volume of 100ml of sterile, pyrogen-free 0.9% sodium chloride. No incompatibilities between bevacizumab and polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin bags have been observed (error! reference source not found). Bevacizumab infusions should not be administered or mixed with dextrose or glucose solutions . Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. The initial bevacizumab dose should be delivered over 90 minutes as an intravenous infusion. If the first infusion is well tolerated,the second infusion may be administered over 60 minutes. If the 60-minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes.
            After resolution of the vial content chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours at 2°C-30°C in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. However, from a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately.<br><br>

            <strong>Drugs inter:</strong> No formal drug interaction studies with other antineoplastic agents have been conducted. However, the existing data suggest that bevacizumab does not affect the pharmacokinetics of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), carboplatin, paclitaxel and doxorubicin.<br><br>

            <strong>Storage:</strong> Store vials in a refrigerator at 2°C-8°C. Keep vial in the outer carton of the refrigerator due to light sensitivity. Do not freeze. Do not shake. 4ml (100mg) vial x l's pack: 39375.00 MRP</p>

          <h3> CISPLATIN: Injection  </h3>
          <p>Cisplatin is a cytotoxic antineoplastic drug <br><br>

          <strong>Ind:</strong> Certain solid tumors including metastatic testis carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, and head & neck tumors.<br><br>

<strong>A/R:</strong> It is a toxic drug. Common problems include severe nausea and vomiting, may persist for 1-7 days after treatment. The symptoms may be so severe that discontinuation of therapy is indicated. Anti-emetics may cause less severe nausea and vomiting.
Nephrotoxicity is dose-related and cumulative; initially it is reversible, but repeated cisplatin administration may cause irreversible renal function impairment. The risk of nephrotoxicity can be reduced by prehydration and careful monitoring (renal abnormalities are manifested by elevations in BUN, serum uric acid and creatinine, and a decrease in creatinine clearance). Myelotoxicity (myelosuppression occurs in 25- 30% of patients receiving cisplatin, but is usually not severe).
Ototoxicity- high tone hearing loss and tinnitus in about 30% of patients; hearing loss may be unilateral and is dose dopendent & it may be irreversible. Ototoxicity may be more severe in children or in the elderly.
Neurotoxicity (is dose-dependent and usually occurs after prolonged treatment)- bilateral, sensoric neuropathy, manifested by paresthesias, decreased vibratory sensation and decreased deep- tendon reflexes. Optic neuritis, with temporary blindness has been reported.
Cardiac toxicity and SGOT elevations have been reported.
There may be hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Patients should have a normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 90ml/min) prior to start of therapy with platosin. Before administration, adequate hydration and diuresis should be ascertained, and appropriate anti-emetic medication should be given. Audiometric monitoring is recommended prior to and during therapy with platosin.
The toxic effects commonly necessitate dose reduction and/or drug withdrawal. It is preferable that treatment with this drug be super-vised by specialists familiar with its use.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Platosin, powder for injection 10mg and 50mg should be reconstituted with 10ml or 50ml respectively, of sterile normal saline. To decrease the nephrotoxicity pretreatment hydration with atleast 1 litre of 5% dextrose/ 0.9% saline (1:1) is recommended. When urine flow is less than 100ml per hour, 100-200ml 15% mannitol may be administered. It is recommen ded to administer Platosin in 2 litres 5% dextrose/ 0.9% saline (1:1) intravenously in 6-8 hours; after administration, hydration and diuresis should be maintained during 24 hours. The next dose of Platosin should not be given until the renal function has returned to normal (creatinine clearance > 90ml/min). The usual dose of Platosin is 50-100mg/m2 as a single intravenous administration or 20mg/m2 intravenously on each of 5 consecutive days. The dose may be adjusted, depending on combination with other cytostatics. A course can be administered once every 3-4 weeks, depending on results of blood tests, renal function tests and audiometrice tests.

          <h3> HYDREA Cap. Bristol-Myers Squibb/ Kapricorn (HYDROXYCARBAMIDE)  </h3>
          <p>  Hydroxyurea USP 500mg/capsule<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Hydroxyurea is an antineoplastic
agent. It's mode of action is still hypothetical, that hydroxyurea causes an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis by acting as a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, without interfering with synthesis of ribonucleic acid or of protein.
For more information, consult manufacturer's literature.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Significant tumor response to hydroxyurea has been demostrated in melanoma, resistant chronic myelocytic leukemia, & metastatic, or inoperable carcinoma of the ovary.
Hydroxyurea used concomitantly with irradiation therapy is intended for use in the local control of primary squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinomas of the head & neck, excluding the lip.
Hydroxyurea is contraindicated in patients with marked bone marrow depression i.e leukopenia ( less than 2500/mm3 WBC) or thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000/mm3), or severe anemia. Known hypersensitivity to hydroxyurea or any other component of its formulation.<br><br>

<strong>A/R:</strong> Adverse reactions have been primarily bone marrow depression (leukopenia, anemia, and occasionally thrombocytopenia), and less frequently gastrointestinal symptoms (stomatitis, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation), and dermatological reactions such
as maculopapular rash, skin ulceration, dermatomyositis-like skin changes, peripheral and facial erythema. Hyperpigmentation, atrophy of
skin and nails, scaling and violet papules have
been observed in some patients after several years
of long-term daily maintenance therapy with hydroxyurea.
For more information, please consult
manufacturer's literature.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Therapy with hydroxyurea requires close supervision. The complete status of the blood, including bone marrow examination, if indicated, as well as kidney function and liver function should be determined prior to, and repeatedly during treatment. The determination of the hemoglobin level, total leukocyte counts, and platelet counts should be performed at least once a week throughout the course of hydroxyurea therapy. If
the white blood cell count decreases to less than 2500/mm3, or the platelet count to less than 100,000/mm3, therapy should be interrupted until
the values rise significantly toward normal levels. Severe anemia, if it occurs, should be managed without interrupting hydroxyurea therapy. Hydroxyurea should be used with caution in patients with marked renal dysfunction. Patients
who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis
or hepatotoxicity should permanently discontinue therapy with hydroxyurea.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Drugs which affect DNA synthesis, such as hydroxyurea, may be potential mutagenic agents. Hydroxyurea can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.But, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should
be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.
Hydroxyurea is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions with hydroxyurea, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> All dosages of hydroxyurea should be based on the patients actual or ideal weight whichever is less. Concurrent use of hydroxyurea with other myelosuppressive agents may require adjustment of dosages. Solid tumours: Intermittent therapy: 80mg/kg administered orally as a single dose every third day. Continuous therapy: 20-30mg/kg administered orally as a single dose daily.
Concomitant therapy with irradiation: Carcinoma of the head & neck- 80mg/kg administered orally as a single dose every third day.
Administration of hydroxyurea should begin at least seven days before initiation of irradiation & continued during radiotherapy as well as indefinitely afterwards provided that the patient may be kept under adequate observation & evidences on unusual or severe reactions. Resistant chronic myelocytic leukemia: Until the intermittent therapy regimen has been evaluated, continuous therapy (20-30mg/kg administered orally as a single dose daily) is recommended. An adequate trial period for determining the antineoplastic effectiveness of hydroxyurea is six weeks of therapy. When there is regression in tumor size or arrest in tumor growth, therapy should be continued indefinitely. Therapy should be interrupted if the white blood cell count drops below 2500/mm3, or the platelet count below 100,000/mm3. In these cases, the counts should be re-evaluated after three days & therapy resumed when the counts return to acceptable levels. Since the hematopoietic rebound is prompt, it is usually necessary to omit only a few doses. It prompt rebound has not occurred during combined hydroxyurea & irradiation therapy, irradiation may also be interrupted. However, the need for postponement of irradiation has been rare. Severe anemia, if it occurs, should be corrected without interrupting hydroxyurea therapy.In patients who have recently received extensive radiation therapy or chemotherapy with other cytotoxic drugs, hydroxyurea should be administered cautiously.<br><br>

Pediatric use: Safety & effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. <br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> There are no data on concomitant use of hydroxyurea with other drugs in humans. Concurrent use of hydroxyurea and other myelosuppressive agents or radiation therapy may increase the likelihood of bone marrow depression or other adverse events.
Since hydroxyurea may raise the serum uric acid level. Dosage adjustment of uricosuric medication may be necessary.
Note: For more information, please consult manufacturer's literature.

          <h3>TARCEVA Tab. Roche (ERLOTINIB)  </h3>
          <p>  Erlotinib 150mg/tablet (film-coated).
Erlotinib is a highly potent selective and orally available anti-cancer drug. It is a valuable new treatment option with a proven survival benefit in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). <br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Erlotinib is a human epidermal growth factor receptor (HERI/EGFR) tyrosine- kinase (TK) inhibitor. Erlotinib inhibits the binding of adenosine triphosphate to the intracellular TK domain of HERI/EGFR.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Erlotinib is indicated for: 1. The treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. 2. Treatment of pancreatic cancer. 3. Treatment of other solid malignancies (glioma, head & neck etc.).<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Severe hypersensitivity to erlotinib or to any of the excipients.<br><br>

<strong>A/R:</strong> Rash (75%) and diarrhoea (54%) were the most commnoly reported adverse reactions. Most were Grade1/2 in severity and manageable without intervention. Grade 3/4 rash and diarrhoea occurred in 9% and 6% respectively in erlotinib- treated patients and each resulted in study discontinuation in 1% of patients. Dose reduction for rash and diarrhoea was needed in 6% and 1% of patients, respectively. In study BR.21, the median time to onset of rash was 8 days, and the median time to onset of diarrhoea was 12 days.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> There are no studies in pregnant women using erlotinib. Studies in animals have shown some reproductive toxicity. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on erlotinib. Adequate contraceptive methods should be used during therapy, and for at least 2 weeks after completing therapy. Treatment should only be continued in pregnant women if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the foetus. It is not known whether erlotinib is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential harm to the infant, mothers should be advised to discontinue breast feeding while receiving erlotinib.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> The recommended daily dose of erlotinib is 150mg taken at least one hour before or two hours after having food. Erlotinib treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer therapies.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Caution should be exercised when erlotinib is combined with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, e.g azole antifungals (i.e ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), protease inhibitors, erythromycin or clarithromycin. If necessary, the dose of erlotinib should be reduced, particularly if toxicity is observed. Patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants, should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time or INR. Patients who are still smoking should be encouraged to stop smoking while taking erlotinib, as plasma concentrations could be reduced otherwise. Concomitant administration of inhibitors of Pgp, e.g cyclosporine and verapamil, may lead to altered distribution and/or altered elimination of erlotinib. The effect of antacids, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists on the absorption of erlotinib have not been investigated but absorption may be impaired, leading to lower plasma levels. Caution should be exercised when these medicinal products are combined with erlotinib.<br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Recommended dosage- 350mg/m2 administered by i.v infusion over a 30- to 90-minute period every 3 weeks as single agent. Dosage adjustments- in patients who experienced asymptomatic severe neutropenia (neutrophil count  less than 500 cells/mm3), fever or infections associated with neutropenia (temperature > 380C and neutrophil count < 1,000 cells/mm3) or severe diarrhoea (requiring an intravenous rehydration), dosage should be reduced from 350mg/m2 to 300mg/m2; if the patient again experiences severe neutropenia, fever or infections associated with neutropenia as defined above or severe diarrhoea, the dosageshouldbedecreasedfrom300mg/m2 to 250mg/m2 atthenextcycle.Delayeddosing- irinotecan should not be administered until the neutrophil count returns to above 1,500 cells/mm3. In patients who experienced severe neutropenia or severe gastrointestinal adverse events such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, dosing of irinotecan should be delayed until there has been a full recovery of these symptoms, specially diarrhoea. Treatment duration- treatment with irinotecan should be continued until there is an objective progression of the disease or an unacceptable toxicity.<br><br>

Special populations: Patients with impaired hepatic fuction: Patients with a bilirubin < 1.5 times the ULN should not be treated with irinotecan. Patients with impaired renal function: Irinotecan is not recommended for use as studies in this population have not been conducted. Elderly: No specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in elderly, however the dose should be chosen carefully in this population due to their greater frequency of decreased biological functions, in particular hepatic function.

          <h3> PACLITAXEL: Injection </h3>
          <p> Paclitaxel is a natural product with anti-tumor activity. It is obtained by semi-synthetic process from Taxus baccata.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Paclitaxel is indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary. As the first-line therapy, paclitaxel is indicated in combination with cisplatin. Paclitaxel is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of node-positive breast cancer administered sequentially to standard doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapy. In the clinical trial, there was an overall favorable effect on disease- free and overall survival in the total population of patients with receptor-positive and receptor- negative tumors, but the benefit has been specifically demonstrated by available data (median follow-up 30 months) only in the patients with estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative
tumors.
Paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated.
Paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy.
Paclitaxel is indicated for the second-line treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. <br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Paclitaxel is contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel or other drugs formulated in Cremophor EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil).
Paclitaxel should not be used in patients with solid tumors who have baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1500 cells/mm3 or in patients with AIDS- related Kaposi's sarcoma with baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1000 cells/mm3.
<br><br>

<strong>S/E; Warnings; Preacution:</strong> Please consult manufacturer's literature.
Contact of the undiluted concentrate with plasticized PVC equipments or devices used to prepare solutions for infusion is not recommended. In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticized DEHP [di-(2- ethylhexyl) phthalate], which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets; diluted paclitaxel solutions should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through polyethylene-lined administration sets.
<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> All patients should be premeditated prior to paclitaxel administration in order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions. Such premedication may consist of dexamethasone 20mg administered orally approximately 12 and 6 hours before
paclitaxel, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50mg I.V 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel, and cimetidine (300mg) or ranitidine (50mg) I.V 30 to 60 minutes before paclitaxel. Treatment regimen: For patients with carcinoma of the ovary, the following regimens are recommended.
1. For previously untreated patients with carcinoma of the ovary, one of the following recommended regimens may be given every 3 weeks. In selecting the appropriate regimen, differences in toxicities should be considered.<br><br>

b.
Paclitaxel administered i.v over 3 hours at a dose of 175mg/m2
followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75mg/m2. Or,
Paclitaxel administered i.v over 24 hours at a dose of 135mg/m2 followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75mg/m2.
2. In patients previously treated with chemotherapy for carcinoma of the overy, paclitaxel has been used at several doses and schedules; however, the optimal regimen is not yet clear. The recommended regimen is paclitaxel 135mg/m2or175mg/m2 asministeredi.v
over 3 hours every 3 weeks.
For patients with carcinoma of the breast, the following regimens are recommended.<br><br>


2.
For the adjuvant treatment of node- positive breast cancer, the recommended regimen is paclitaxel, at a dose of
175mg/m2 i.v over 3 hours every 3 weeks for 4 courses administered sequentially to doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapy.
After failure of initial chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, paclitaxel at a dose of 175mg/m2 administered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks has been shown to be effective.
Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma: The recommended regimen is 135mg/m2 administered intravenously over 24 hours followedbycisplatin75mg/m2 every3weeks. Patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma: Paclitaxel adminstered at a dose of 135mg/m2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks oratadoseof100mg/m2 givenintravenously over 3 hours every 2 weeks is recommended (dose intensity 45-50mg/m2/week). In the two clinical trials evaluating these schedules, the formerschedule(135mg/m2 every3weeks)was more toxic than the latter. In addition, all patients with low performance status were treated with the latter schedule (100mg/m2 every 2 weeks).<br><br>

          <h3>VESANOID Cap. Roche (RETINOIC ACID) </h3>
          <p> All trans retinoic acid 10mg/capsule (soft gelatin). <strong>Mode of action:</strong> Tretinoin is not a cytolytic agent but instead induces cyto-differentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo.
<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Retinoic acid is indicated for the induction of remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), French-American-British (FAB) classification M3 (including the M3 variant), or who are refractory to, or who have relapsed from, anthracycline chemotherapy, or for whom anthracycline-based chemotherapy is contraindicated. All patients should receive consolidation and/or maintenance therapy after completion of induction therapy with retinoic acid. <br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Retinoic acid is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to retinoids.
<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Virtually all patients experience some drug related toxicity, specially headache, fever, weakness, and fatigue. These adverse effects are seldom permanent or irreversible nor do they usually require interruption of therapy. Some of the adverse events are common in patients with APL, including hemorrhage, infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pneumonia, septicemia, and cerebral hemorrhage.
<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Retinoic acid syndrome (RAS): In up to 25% of patients with APL treated with retinoic acid, a syndrome occurs which can be fatal. High dose dexamethasone for 2-3 days should be initiated immediately. Anthracycline based chemotherapy can be added when WBC counts are higher (5x109/l). <br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Retinoic acid should not be used during pregnancy and lactation. Effective contraception must be used by all females during retinoic acid therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of therapy.
<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> The recommended dose is 45mg/m2/day administered as two equally divided doses until complete remission is documented. Therapy should be discontinued 30 days after achievement of complete
remission or after 90 days of treatment, whichever occurs first.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer who have tumors that overexpress HER2: (a) in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease; (b) as monotherapy who have pre-treated with chemotherapy.
<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Trastuzumab is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to trastuzumab or to any other component of the product.
<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> The most common adverse reactions are infusion-related symptoms, such as fever and chills, usually following the first infusion of trastuzumab.
Cardiac toxicity: Signs and symptoms of cardiac dysfunction, such as dyspnea, orthopnea,
increased cough, pulmonary edmea, S3 gallop, or reduced ejection fraction, have been observed in patients treated with trastuzumab.
Hematological toxicity: Leukopenia, thrombocyto penia and anemia occurring in less than 1% of patients. No WHO grade IV toxicities were observed. <br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Serious adverse reactions to trastuzumab infusion including dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation and respiratory distress have been reported infrequently. The trastuzumab infusion should be discontinued and the patient monitored until resolution of any observed symptoms. Serious reactios have been treated successfully with supportive therapy such as oxygen, beta-agonists and corticosteroids.
<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Trastuzumab should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation unless the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> HER2: Testing is mandatory prior to initiation of trastuzumab therapy. Loading dose: The recommended initial loading dose is 4mg/kg body weight as a 90-minute intravenous infusion.
Subsequent doses: The recommended weekly dose of trastuzumab is 2mg/kg body weight. If the initial dose does not cause any intolerance, the following dose can be administered as a 30- minute infusion; should not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. In clinical studies, patients were treated with trastuzumab until progression of disease.
Elderly: Data suggest that the disposition of trastuzumab is not altered based on age.<br><br>

 <strong>Storage:</strong> Store vials at 2-8°C. Reconstituted solution is stable for 28 days when stored refrigerated at 2-8°C. The reconstituted solution contains preservative and is therefore suitable for multiple use.<br>

           <strong>Ind:</strong> Treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. Treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in combination with CHOP.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Known hypersensitivity to any component of this product or to murine proteins.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Monotherapy: Infusion related adverse reactions occur in more than 50% of patients. These events mainly comprise fever, chills and rigors. Other symptoms include flushing, angioedema, nausea, urticaria/rash, fatigue, headache, throat irritation, rhinitis, vomiting and tumour pain. These symptoms accompanied by hypotension and bronchospasm in about 10% of the cases.
Cardiovascular system: Severe cardiac events, including heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarction have been observed, mainly in patients with prior cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy and are mostly associated with infusion-related reactions.<br><br>

Respiratory system: Pulmonary adverse reactions include severe bronchoconstriction and rare fatalities.
<br><br>

Skin & appendages: Severe bullous skin reactions, including fatal cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported rarely.<br><br>

<strong>Nervous system:</strong> Cranial neuropathy with or without peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms (e.g loss of senses and facial nerve palsy) can occur up to several months following completion of therapy. Body as a whole: Serum sickness like reactions. Others: Serious or opportunistic infections were considerably less than reported with conventional chemotherapy. During treatment and up to one year following therapy, approximately 17% and 16% respectively, of patients developed infections which were usually common, non-opportunistic and mild. For additional adverse events which occurred in about 1% of patients please see full prescribing information. Severe adverse events occurring in less than 1% of patients were coagulation disorder, asthma and lung disorder.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions:</strong> Patients with a high number (>25,000 mm3) of circulating malignant cells or high tumour burden, are at a higher risk of severe cytokine release syndrome. These patients should be treated with caution and should be closely monitored during the first infusion. A reduced infusion rate should be considered for the first infusion. This syndrome may be associated with some features of tumour lysis syndrome. The syndrome frequently manifests itself within one or two hours of initiating the first infusion. Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency, those with pulmonary tumour infiltration and patients with a history of cardiac disease and/or cardiotoxic chemotherapy should be treated with caution. Further treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms has rarely resulted in repeated severe cytokine release syndrome. Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These may typically occur within minutes after starting the infusion. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manfestations of the cytokine release syndrome. Since hypotension may occur, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medications 12 hours prior to the infusion. There is limited clinical experience in patients with neutrophils less than 1.5 x 109/l and/or platelet counts less than 75 x 1091. Periodic monitoring of a full blood count (including platelets) should be considered during monotherapy. When rituximab is given in combination with CHOP, regular full blood counts should be performed.<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Rituximab should not be given to a pregnant women unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Rituximab may cause B-cell depletion in the foetus. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception both during and for up to 12 months following rituximab therapy. Rituximab should not be given to nursing women.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Rituximab solution should be administered as an IV infusion through a delicated line. Premedication consisting of paracetamol and an antihistamine should be administered before each infusion. Premedication with corticosteroids should be considered. Patients should be closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome.
Follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: 375mg/m2, as an intravenous infusion once weekly for four weeks.First infusion: The recommended initial rate for infusion is 50mg/hour; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated in 50mg/hour increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400mg/hour. If hypersensitivity or an infusion related event develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted and can continue at one half the previous rate upon improvement of symptoms. If the same adverse reactions occur severely for second time the decision to stop treatment should be
considered. The infusion rate may be increased upon improvement of symptoms.
Subsequent infusions: Infuse at initial rate of 100mg/hour and increase by 100mg/hour increments at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400mg/hour. Patients who have responded to rituximab have been retreated with comparable response rates to first treatment.<br><br>

<strong>Children:</strong> Safety and efficacy of rituximab in children have not been established.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Currently, no data are available on possible drug interactions with rituximab. 100mg (10ml) vial x l's pack: 28125.00 MRP 500mg (50ml) vial x l's pack: 135000.00 MRP  </p>

          <h3> INTERFERON  </h3>
          <p> Interferons are naturally occuring proteins with complex effects on immunity & cell function. Recently a-Interferons (formerly called lymphoblastoid interferon) has shown some anti- tumour action in certain lymphomas & solid tumors. The precise role of interferon in cancer treatment is controversial & often ill defined. <br><br>

  <strong>Ind:</strong> Chronic myelogenous leukaemia, multiple myeloma, malignant melanoma, hairy cell leukaemia, renal cell carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma in AIDS patients, follicular non- Hodgkins lymphoma & for improvement of viraemia of chronic active hepatitis-B
<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Side-effects are dose-related, but commonly include influenza-like symptoms. Initially tiredness, somnolence, weight loss, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, loss of taste, diarrohea & headache.
Myelosuppression may also occur, particularly affecting granulocyte counts. CVS problems (hypotension, hypertension & arrhythmias), & hepatotoxicity have been reported. Other side- effects include thyroid abnormalities, psoriasiform rash, coma & seizures (usually with high doses in elderly).<br><br>

<strong>Cautions:</strong> It is unwise to use Interferon in patients over 75 yrs. of age because of neurotoxicity. During treatment the leucocyte count should be maintained at low levels between 2 and 5x109/L.<br><br>

<strong>Dose:</strong> In chronic myeloid leukaemia, this is given i.m or s.c 3-9 mega units (m.u) daily. It can induce control & maintain control of this disease in chronic phase in about 70% of patients.
Multiple myeloma & renal cell carcinoma- 3 to 18 million units by i.m injection once daily according to the clinical judgement of the physician. Malignantmelanoma-12millionunits/m2 of body surface area by i.m injection 3 times weekly.
Improvement of viraemia of chronic hepatitis B- 9 to 18 million units daily by i.m injection. Dosage may be increased to 18 million units after the initial 3 days of treatment with 9 million units according to the patient's
condition.   </p>

Other adverse events include gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), asthenia, joint pain/stiffness, somnolence, headache or rash. Vaginal bleeding has been reported infrequently- evaluate further if it persists. Slight increase in total cholesterol. Hepatic enzyme changes and thromboembolic events, but no causal relationships established. <br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Menopause should be defined biochemically in any patient where doubt about hormonal status. Care in driving or operating machinery. No data to support safety in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment. Women with osteoporosis or at risk of osteoporosis should have their bone mineral density assessed at the commencement of treatment and at regular intervals thereafter. Treatment or prophylaxis for osteoporosis should be initiated as appropriate and carefully monitored. No information on use in combination with other anticancer drugs. <br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> As this drug is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer in post- menopausal women, this is not applicable for using in pregnancy & lactation.<br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> 1mg (one tablet) to be taken orally once a day.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Con-administration of anastrozole
with other drugs (e.g antipyrine and cimetidine) is unlikely to result in clinically significant drug interactions mediated by cytochrome P450. A review of the clinical trial safety database did not reveal evidence of clinically significant interactions in patients treated with anastrozole receiving other commonly prescribing drugs. 1mg x 28's pack: 11005.96 MRP   </p>

          <h3>CASODEX Tab. AstraZeneca/ACI (BICALUTAMIDE) </h3>
          <p> Bicalutamide 50mg/tablet (film-coated).<br><br>

<strong>Mode of action:</strong> Bicalutamide is a non-steroidal anti-androgen, devoid of other endocrine activity. It binds to androgen receptors without activating gene expression, and thus inhibits the androgen stimulus. Regression of prostatic tumours results from this inhibition. Clinically,discontinuation of bicalutamide can result in antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome in a subset of patients. Bicalutamide is a recemate with its antiandrogenic activity being almost exclusively in the (R)-enantiomer.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Treatment of advanced prostate cancer in combination with LHRH analogue therapy or surgical castration.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Bicalutamide is contra-indicated in females and children. Patient who has shown a hypersensitivity reaction to this drug. Co- administration of terfenadine, astemizole or cisapride with bicalutamide is contra-indicated.<br><br> 

<strong>A/R:</strong> Bicalutamide in general, has been well tolerated with few withdrawals due to adverse events. In addition, some adverse experiences were reported in clinical trials (with a frequency of 1%) during treatment with bicalutamide plus an LHRH analogue. No causal relationship of these experiences to drug treatment has been made and some of the experiences reported are those that commonly occur in elderly patients. These include: Heart failure; anorexia, dry mouth, dyspepsia, constipation, flatulence; headache, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, decreased libido; dyspnoea; impotence, nocturia; anaemia; alopecia, rash, sweating, hirsutism; diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia, oedema, weight gain, weight loss; body pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, pelvic pain, chills.
<br><br>

<strong>Precautions & warnings:</strong> Bicalutamide is extensively metabolised in the liver, so bicalutamide should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Periodic liver function tests should be considered due to the possibility of hepatic changes. The majority of changes are expected to occur within the first 6 months of bicalutamide therapy.
Severe hepatic changes have been observed rarely with bicalutamide, and in that case, therapy should be discontinued.
<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Bicalutamide is contra- indicated in females and must not be given to pregnant women or nursing mothers. 

<br><br><strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Adults & elderly: 50mg (one tablet) once a day. Treatment with bicalutamide should be started at the same time as treatment with an LHRH analogue (such as goserelin) or surgical castration.No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment, and for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Increased accumulation may occur in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment Children: Bicalutamide is contra-indicated in chidren.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Please consult manufacturer's literature.

          <h3> FLUTAMIDE  </h3>
          <p> Flutamide is a hormone-antagonist, non steroidal anti-androgen drug. It acts by inhibiting androgen uptake and/or inhibiting nuclear binding of androgen in target tissues.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> Prostate cancer- palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer in previously untreated patients or those who have not responded or who have become refractory to hormonal manipulation. <br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Hypersensitivity to flutamide.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Most frequently reported are gynaecomastia and/or breast tenderness sometimes accompained by galactorrhoea. These side-effects usually disappear upon discontinuation of treatment or reduction in dosage.
Other side-effects are-<br>
1. Gastrointestinal- nausea, vomiting, increased appetite thirst, diarrhoea, constipation, anorexia & indigestion, gastric & chest pain.<br>
2. Cardiovascular- rarely thrombophleb-itis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction.<br>
3. CNS- insomnia, tiredness, & rarely headache, dizziness, malaise, weakness, anxiety, blurred vision.<br>
4. Others- pruritus, echymosis, rashes, SLE-like syndrome, lymphoedema, transient abnormal liver function, jaundice, haematuria.<br>
5. Decreased libido, inhibition of spermat- ogenesis reported in long-term treatment.<br>
If side-effects are remarkable or severe, a reduction in dosage or discontinuation in treatment is advised.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions:</strong> Periodic liver function tests (for hepatotoxicity); cardiac disease (sodium retention with oedema). In long-term treatment, sperm count must be performed.<br><br>

          <h3>ZOLADEX Inj. AstraZeneca/ACI (GOSERELIN)  </h3>
          <p> Each pre-filled injection contains, goserelin acetate equivalent to 3.6mg peptide base in a sustained release depot. It is supplied as a single dose pre-filled syringe applicator (with a protective sleeve in a sealed pouch which contains a desiccant) to be administered every 4 weeks. <br><br>

          <strong>Mode of action:</strong> Goserelin is a synthetic analogue of naturally occurring LHRH (luteinizing hormone releasing hormone). On chronic administration, goserelin results in inhibition of pituitary LH secretion leading to a fall in serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations in women and men, respectively. Initially, there may be a transient increase in serum sex steroid hormone concentration. By around 21 days after the first depot injection, estrogen or testosterone concentrations fall to within castrate range and remain suppressed with continuous treatement every 28 days. This inhibition leads to breast or prostate tumour regression and symptomatic improvement in the majority of patients.<br><br>

<strong>Ind:</strong> 1. Prostate cancer. Goserelin is indicated in the management of prostate cancer suitable for hormonal manipulation. 2. Breast cancer. Goserelin is indicated in the management of breast cancer in premenopausal and perimenopausal women suitable for hormonal manipulation. 3. Endometriosis. In the management of endometriosis, goserelin alleviates symptoms, including pain and reduces the size and number of endometrial lesions. 4. Uterine fibroids. In conjunction with iron therapy in the haematological improvement of anaemic patients with fibroids prior to surgery. 5. Endometrial thinning. Goserelin is indicated for the prethinning of the uterine endometrium prior to endometrial ablation or resection. 6. Assisted reproduction. Pituitary downregulation in preparation for superovulation.<br><br>

<strong>C/I:</strong> Hypersensitivity to goserelin or other LHRH analogues. Pregnancy and lactation.<br><br>

<strong>S/E:</strong> Rarely hypersensitivity, skin rashes, generally mild. Arthralgia. Changes in blood pressure. Occasional mild bruising at injection site.
Males: Hot flushes, decrease in potency, infrequently breast swelling and tenderness; temporary increase in bone pain, isolated case of ureteric obstruction and spinal cord compression have been recorded.
Females: Hot flushes and sweating, change in libido, headaches, mood changes including depression, change in breast size. Temporary increase in signs and symptoms. Degeneration of fibroids.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions:</strong> Males: Use in patients at particular risk of developing ureteric obstruction or spinal cord compression should be considered carefully and patients monitored during first month of therapy. Females: Exclude pregnancy before treatment. Non-hormonal contraception should be employed during therapy. Loss of bone mineral density, which may recover on cessation of therapy. Caution in women with known metabolic bone disease. Increase in cervical resistance, requiring care if dilating the cervix. Currently, there are no clinical data on the effects of treating benign endometriosis conditions with goserelin for periods in excess of six months. An increase in benign pituitary tumours has been observed in male rats following long-term repeated dosing (relevance to man not established). Pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia and a benign proliferative condition in the pyloric region of the stomach observed in mice following long-term repeated dosing with human dose (relevance to man is unknown). There is no evidence that goserelin results in impairment of ability to drive or operate machinery.
<br><br>

<strong>Pregnancy & lactation:</strong> Goserelin is contraindicated during pregnancy & lactation. <strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Adults: One 3.6mg depot goserelin injection to be given subcutaneously into the anterior abdominal wall, every 28 days. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal & hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly. Children: Goserelin is not indicated for use in children.<br><br>

<strong>Drug inter:</strong> Please consult manufacturer's literature<br> <br> 

<strong>Storage:</strong> Store below 255 C.<br><br>

<strong>Precautions:</strong> Safety and efficacy have not been established in myelodysplasia, acute myelogenous leukaemia, or chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Exercise caution in any malignant or premalignant myeloid condition. Leucocytosis (WBC> 100 x109/L) has been seen at doses seen above 0.3 million units (3mcg)/kg/day in less than 5% of patients. In addition, as higher doses of chemotherapy may be administered, resulting in an increased risk of thrombocytopenia and anaemia, regular haematological monitoring is recommended. For sustained response, filgrastim should be continued until after the expected nadir and until the neutrophil count has recovered. Bone density monitoring is advised for patients with osteoporotic disease receiving filgrastim for
longer than 6 months.Use of filgrastim in severe renal or hepatic impairments is not recommended.<br><br>

Pregnancy & lactation- no evidence of teratogenicity but increased embryo-loss has been seen in rabbits. Administer to expectant mothers only if benefits is likely to exceed potential risk to foetus. Not recommended in nursing mothers. <br><br>

<strong>Dosage & admin:</strong> Cytotoxic-induced neutropenia- adult & child, 0.5 million units (5mcg)/kg/day (first dose started not less than 24 hours after chemotherapy) as a daily s.c injection or i.v infusion (over 30 minutes). Treatment should be continued until neutrophil count in normal range, usually for up to 14 days (up to 38 days in acute myeloid leukaemia).
